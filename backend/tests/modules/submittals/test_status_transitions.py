"""Tests for the submittal FSM transition table.

The frontend's <SubmittalStatusPipeline> mirrors this table, so any
change here is a contract break with the UI stepper. Pin the allow-list
of transitions so a careless refactor trips before the visual review
regresses.

These are pure-data tests — no DB / no fixtures required.
