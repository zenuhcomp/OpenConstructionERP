# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""Determinism regression test for the match pipeline.

Background: prior bench runs measured recall@1 between 0.20 and 0.45 on
the same code / fixtures / Qdrant state — different backend processes
produced different results, making any A/B comparison useless because
run-to-run variance dominated the signal.

This test locks the contract:

    Given OE_MATCH_DETERMINISTIC=1, two consecutive ``match_element``
    calls on the same envelope MUST return identical top-K rate codes
    AND identical scores.

Two tiers of tests live here:

1. **Always-on (no infra)** — exercise the determinism module directly:
   seed pinning, sort stabilisation, env-var probe.
2. **Live-infra-gated** — run the full pipeline against the live Qdrant
   + BGE encoder stack. Skipped when ``CWICR_QDRANT_URL`` isn't set so
   CI on minimal installs still passes.

The live tier is the load-bearing one for the "fix non-determinism"
claim. The always-on tier guards against future refactors breaking the
stabilisation primitives.
