"""Pin the Round-6 N+1 fix on the measurement PATCH / DELETE / link path.

Pre-fix, ``service.update_measurement`` / ``delete_measurement`` /
``link_measurement_to_boq`` each ran ``self.get_measurement(...)`` even
though the router had *already* fetched the row for the IDOR check via
``verify_project_access``. That doubled the ``SELECT`` count on every
mutation — visible as a 2× SQL load when an estimator was bulk-editing
measurements on a large takeoff.

This test patches ``MeasurementRepository.get_by_id`` and asserts the
service uses the pre-fetched row when one is supplied via the new
``existing=`` kwarg — so the production code path stays at exactly one
lookup per request.
