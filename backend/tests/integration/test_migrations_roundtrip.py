"""Alembic up/down round-trip tests (Wave 3-D / Task #237).

Goal: catch the "missing or broken downgrade()" CI bug class — i.e. a
recent migration whose ``downgrade()`` is empty or doesn't reverse what
``upgrade()`` did. The cheapest way to surface that is to run
``upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade`` cycles on a fresh SQLite DB.

Schema-creation reality (see ``app/main.py`` ~L1395):
  • The init revision ``129188e46db8`` is intentionally a no-op — its
    docstring says "Tables are created by SQLAlchemy at app startup".
  • The app boots by running ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` first,
    *then* ``alembic upgrade head`` (Alembic only carries column-level
    or new-table deltas after the metadata create).
  • Therefore plain ``alembic upgrade head`` on an empty DB doesn't
    work — e.g. ``v270_position_version_column`` does
    ``inspector.get_columns("oe_boq_position")`` which raises
    ``NoSuchTableError`` because that table comes from create_all,
    not from a migration. This is **expected** project behaviour, not
    a bug to fix here.

Test strategy (mirrors production):
  1. ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` to lay down the schema.
  2. ``alembic stamp head`` to mark all migrations as applied.
  3. For each recent revision ``R``:
     a. ``downgrade R^`` — peel just R off the stamped head.
     b. ``upgrade head`` — re-apply R (and any siblings).
     c. Assert: post-cycle schema matches pre-cycle schema.

Isolation: every test gets its own ``tempfile.mkdtemp()`` SQLite file
(``feedback_test_isolation.md`` — never touch ``backend/openestimate.db``).

PostgreSQL-only revisions (none today; placeholder for future) are
skipped via ``PG_ONLY_REVS``.

Runtime: ~5–15 s per parametrized rev on a warm interpreter. Tier
``integration``.
