"""Integration tests for the password-free demo-login endpoint (v2.6.22).

Covers:
    * Test A — POST /auth/demo-login/ with a whitelisted, seeded email
      returns a valid token pair.
    * Test B — POST /auth/demo-login/ with a NON-whitelisted email returns
      a generic 401 (no enumeration leak about which emails are demo).
    * Test C — When SEED_DEMO=false, the endpoint disables itself and
      returns 404 even for a whitelisted email.
    * Test D — Whitelist must match the seeder spec list — a sync-test
      that fails loudly if the two lists drift apart (BUG-D02 guard).

The demo accounts are auto-seeded on startup by ``app.main._seed_demo_account``
inside the regular lifespan, so we don't need to register them ourselves.
