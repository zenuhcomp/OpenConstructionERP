"""Baseline tests for :class:`TeamService`.

Scope:
    * Create a team within a project.
    * Add a member; verify the membership row exists and carries the
      requested role (the permission-inheritance signal the rest of the
      system reads off ``TeamMembership.role``).
    * Remove the member; verify the row is gone (revoking the inherited
      grant).
    * RBAC self-elevation guard: a non-owner caller cannot grant
      themselves an ELEVATED team role.

Repositories and session are stubbed so the suite doesn't need a live
database. RBAC dependencies (``verify_project_access``,
``_is_project_owner_or_admin``) are monkey-patched per-test so we
exercise the gate without standing up Project / User tables.
