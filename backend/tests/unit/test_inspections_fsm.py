"""FSM lifecycle tests for ``InspectionService.complete_inspection``.

The inspection lifecycle is:

    scheduled → in_progress → completed (terminal)
                            \\
                             → failed → (re-)scheduled

``complete_inspection`` is the capstone transition and must reject
attempts to complete from any state other than ``scheduled`` or
``in_progress``. Before this hardening pass it silently allowed
re-completing from ``failed``, which broke the failed→scheduled
re-inspection contract documented in
``_INSPECTION_STATUS_TRANSITIONS``.
