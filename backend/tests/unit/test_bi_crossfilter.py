# DDC-CWICR-OE: DataDrivenConstruction · OpenConstructionERP
"""‌⁠‍Unit tests for the BI Dashboards cross-filter pipeline (Wave 4 / T11).

These tests stub the KPI registry so we can observe what arguments
``_kpis.compute`` was called with — proving that:

* When ``cross_filter_enabled=False`` (default) the supplied filter
  dict is dropped and ``compute`` is invoked with zero kwargs, matching
  the v3.x static-render contract.
* When ``cross_filter_enabled=True`` the dict is propagated, with
  ``project_id`` / ``period_start`` / ``period_end`` lifted to typed
  kwargs and the remaining keys forwarded as the ``filters=`` bag.
* Unknown filter keys (no KPI knows what to do with them) ride along in
  ``filters=`` without raising — each KPI ignores keys it doesn't
  recognise, so the wire is graceful.
