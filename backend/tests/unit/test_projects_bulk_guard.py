"""Bulk-guard + N+1 contract for ``ProjectService._generate_project_code``.

The generator runs inside ``create_project`` and is invoked once per
new project. It opens with a stale-reservation prune that USED TO call
``ProjectRepository.project_code_exists`` once per entry in the
in-process ``_PROJECT_CODE_RESERVED`` set — pure N+1 against the DB.

Under normal load that's fine (the set rarely exceeds 1-2 entries
because each successful commit GCs its own slot). But two pathological
patterns surface the bug:

1. Long-running uvicorn workers under sustained ``create_project``
   pressure where the prune loop quietly grows the per-acquire DB cost.
2. Batch importers that spin up thousands of ``create_project``
   coroutines without yielding to let earlier commits GC — the set
   bloats unbounded, every acquire then issues N+1 SELECT queries
   AND the bloat itself keeps growing without backpressure.

The fix:

* Batch the prune into a single ``WHERE project_code IN (...)`` query
  (was N point queries).
* Hard cap the reservation set at 500; over-cap creates fail with 422
  instead of letting latency creep silently.

These tests pin:

* The cap fires at the threshold (422, not OOM).
* The prune issues a single SELECT regardless of set size (N+1 → 1).
