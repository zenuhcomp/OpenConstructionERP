"""Integrity tests for the partner-pack flagship country projects.

Each active partner pack ships one fully worked-out demo project authored as
a standalone ``DemoTemplate`` under ``app/core/demo_packs/``. These templates
are merged into ``DEMO_TEMPLATES``, surfaced in ``DEMO_CATALOG``, and mapped
to their pack via ``PACK_DEMO_PROJECT`` so an active pack auto-installs its
country project on first boot.

This module asserts the wiring stays consistent:
1. Every discovered partner pack slug has a demo-project mapping.
2. Every mapped demo_id resolves to a loaded ``DemoTemplate``.
3. Every pack demo project appears in the marketplace catalog with the
   required keys and a derived ISO-2 country.
4. Each pack template is substantial and structurally valid (sections with
   items, allowed units, positive quantities/rates).
