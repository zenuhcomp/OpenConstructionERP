"""‌⁠‍Unit tests for ``detect_converter_capabilities`` — the CLI capability
matrix probe added in v4.6.2 to fix the user-reported "arguments were not
expected" failure on older DDC RvtExporter / IfcExporter binaries.

Coverage:
  * Modern marker found in ``--help`` output → both flags enabled.
  * Legacy banner (no markers) → both flags disabled (safe fallback).
  * Probe process never starts → safe fallback.
  * No binary installed at all → ``probed=False`` sentinel.
  * Cache: second probe never re-invokes subprocess.
  * ``invalidate_converter_capabilities`` clears the cache.
