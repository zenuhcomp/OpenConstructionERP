"""property_dev: buyer-portal magic-link single-use redemption marker.

Adds the nullable ``consumed_at`` timestamp column to
``oe_propdev_portal_token`` so the buyer-portal ``/verify/`` endpoint
can enforce single-use semantics (industry standard — Slack / Notion /
Linear). The column is NULL on issue and is flipped to ``NOW()`` by a
single atomic SQL UPDATE (``WHERE consumed_at IS NULL``) the first
time the magic-link is redeemed. A second / concurrent verify of the
same token cannot succeed — the DB-level race-safety is what gives us
the single-use guarantee, not a Python read-then-write.

Why a new column instead of overloading ``revoked_at``: the two
states are semantically different.

* ``revoked_at`` = "the manager / operator killed this link".
* ``consumed_at`` = "the buyer redeemed this link via /verify/".

Splitting them lets the manager UI keep "active links" (where
``revoked_at IS NULL``) display meaningful counts even after the buyer
has logged in once, and lets the audit report show
"links redeemed but never revoked" vs "links revoked before redemption".

Nullable with ``server_default=None`` — existing rows are NOT
back-filled because they were issued under the multi-use contract; we
treat them as "never consumed" (NULL) and they continue to verify
exactly once before being marked consumed. The fresh-install lock
cascade memory (v3119) doesn't apply here because the column is
nullable.

Idempotent. Down-migration drops the column cleanly.
