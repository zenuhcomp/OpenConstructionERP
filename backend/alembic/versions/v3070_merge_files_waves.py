"""Merge the five /files-waves sibling branches into one head.

Each of W1+W2 (v3060), W3+W4 (v3061), W5+W10 (v3062), W6+W9 (v3063),
W7+W8 (v3064) was authored as a sibling branch of
``v3047_clash_severity_delta`` so the wave agents could run in parallel
without coordination. This empty migration consolidates all five into a
single head so ``alembic upgrade head`` resolves cleanly.
