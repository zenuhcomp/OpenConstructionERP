"""Epic C — Document Versioning Unification.

Adds the unified ``file_version_id`` FK on the comment and markup
tables so the viewer can show stale-version pills and fade markups
that were drawn against a superseded revision::

    oe_file_comment.file_version_id  -> oe_file_version.id (NULL ok)
    oe_markups_markup.file_version_id -> oe_file_version.id (NULL ok)

Both columns are NULLable (no ``server_default`` needed) — legacy rows
predate the FK and are surfaced as "current revision" in the UI.

Backfill
--------
For every existing ``document``, ``photo``, ``sheet`` and ``bim_model``
that does NOT yet have a FileVersion row, this migration inserts a v1
chain entry so the version-chain feature lights up retroactively. The
``id`` is generated via dialect-aware SQL:

    sqlite:    lower(hex(randomblob(16)))
    postgres:  gen_random_uuid()::text  (requires pgcrypto, available
               on the v3.0+ installs we ship — fallback path below if
               the extension is absent)

The ``file_version_snapshot: String(32)`` columns from the previous
release are kept (per Epic C constraints — drop in a later release).
