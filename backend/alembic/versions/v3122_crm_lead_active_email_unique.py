"""crm: unique active-lead email index (lead-dedup atomicity).

R7 audit fix. Two concurrent inbound webhooks targeting the same email
both passed Pydantic + auth and both raced past ``find_by_email`` before
either had flushed its INSERT. With no DB-level constraint the second
write silently created a duplicate active lead — corrupting per-rep
ownership, double-billing on commission, and breaking the GDPR
``forget_lead`` flow (which scrubs one row but leaves the dupe carrying
the same PII).

The unique partial index makes the second INSERT raise ``IntegrityError``
which ``CrmService.create_lead`` already catches and translates to 409
(see ``except IntegrityError`` block). The fix is therefore additive:
existing application logic keeps working; we only close the race window.

Index spec:
    UNIQUE (LOWER(contact_email)) WHERE
        status IN ('new', 'qualifying', 'qualified')
        AND contact_email IS NOT NULL

The ``status`` filter is critical — historical/disqualified/converted
leads must NOT block a fresh inbound for the same person months later.
``LOWER()`` makes the constraint case-insensitive (matches the service
layer's ``.strip().lower()`` normalisation).

PostgreSQL: native partial expression-index support.
SQLite: partial indexes are supported since 3.8.0 (2014) — the same
DDL works on both.
