> ### ▶ After `pip install`, type one command: **`openestimate`**
>
> That's the only thing you need to remember. It prints a welcome,
> asks **press `o` + Enter** to open the app in your browser, then
> starts the server at **http://127.0.0.1:8080**.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install --upgrade openconstructionerp
openestimate                 # welcome screen + o-to-open-browser + server
```

> **Requires Python 3.12+.** Check with `python --version`.

That's the whole first run. The bare `openestimate` command:

1. Prints a welcome with links to docs, issues, and the community chat.
2. Creates a local SQLite database and data folder under `~/.openestimate/`.
3. Starts the server at **http://127.0.0.1:8080** and opens your browser.

Demo login: `demo@openestimator.io` / `DemoPass1234!`

Prefer explicit steps? Run them yourself:

```bash
openestimate init-db         # create the local database
openestimate serve           # start the server
openestimate doctor          # health check if anything looks wrong
openestimate welcome         # re-print the welcome screen + support links
```
