"""Geo Hub permission definitions.

Five families:

* ``geo_hub.read``      — list / get any geo entity.
* ``geo_hub.write``     — create / update anchors, imagery, terrain,
                          viewpoints, overlays.
* ``geo_hub.delete``    — destructive removal of any project-scoped geo
                          entity (anchor, tileset, imagery layer,
                          viewpoint, vector overlay). Gated to MANAGER+
                          because losing a hand-drawn boundary overlay
                          or a manually-anchored project is harder to
                          recover from than re-uploading a raster.
                          (Raster-overlay deletes intentionally stay on
                          ``geo_hub.write`` — they are soft-deletes and
                          R6-audited.)
* ``geo_hub.admin``     — reserved for irreversible operations
                          (delete-all, cross-project cleanup) — gated
                          to MANAGER+.
* ``geo_hub.job_run``   — enqueue + cancel TileGenerationJob (read of
                          jobs is via ``geo_hub.read``).

Tile generation is a write-shaped action — it produces persistent
artefacts in MinIO and consumes CPU — but separating it from
``geo_hub.write`` lets us limit who can hot-spin the CPU budget on the
VPS without forcing them out of basic CRUD.

The router IDOR helper (see ``service._verify_project_owner``) collapses
cross-tenant accesses to 404 so this permission set never leaks
existence to unauthorised callers.
