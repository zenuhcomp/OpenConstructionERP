"""Geo Hub — Cesium 3D Tiles + cross-module geospatial integration.

Adds geospatial capabilities to OpenConstructionERP:

* WGS84 anchors for projects + developments + BIM federations
* Pure-Python canonical-JSON -> glTF (``EXT_structural_metadata``) ->
  3D Tiles 1.1 pipeline (OGC Community Standard, Jan 2025) served from
  the existing MinIO / nginx stack
* Imagery + terrain provider catalogue (OSM, Bing, WMS, Cesium World
  Terrain bring-your-own-ion-key, ellipsoid free fallback)
* GeoJSON / KML import + export for boundaries, easements, drone scans,
  flood / risk overlays
* Saved camera viewpoints per project + 4D-aware metadata so the
  schedule module can animate timeline playback
* Ten cross-module event subscribers (projects / bim_hub / property_dev
  / carbon / schedule / clash / field_reports / safety / risk) so the
  geo dashboard is populated automatically when other modules emit
  domain events

Design notes (see ``RESEARCH_CESIUM_BENTLEY.md``):

* CesiumJS, ``cesium-native``, ``3d-tiles-tools`` and ``gltf-pipeline``
  are all Apache-2.0 — one-way compatible with our AGPL-3.0 community
  ship and our commercial enterprise license.
* Tile generation runs as a job (``TileGenerationJob`` FSM) and writes
  output under ``tilesets/{tileset_id}/`` in the existing storage
  backend.
* No Cesium ion key is required — terrain defaults to the WGS84
  ellipsoid. Cesium World Terrain is offered as a bring-your-own-key
  ``TerrainSource`` so the community ship has no third-party hard
  dependency.
* CesiumJS itself is ~3 MB and lives in a dedicated lazy frontend
  chunk; the main bundle is untouched.
