"""Signed-manifest verifier for converter binaries (Audit A1).

================================================================================
THREAT MODEL
================================================================================

The DDC converter installer (``takeoff/router.py``) downloads several
hundred megabytes of native binaries from the public internet:

    * GitHub Contents API → ``raw.githubusercontent.com`` blobs
      (DDC dwg/rvt/ifc/dgn converters)
    * ``pkg.datadrivenconstruction.io`` Debian repository (Linux .debs)
    * Qdrant releases (vector DB, also pulled per platform)
    * PaddleOCR model archives (lazy, on first use)

A2/A9/A11 (already shipped in v2.x) hardened the *transport*:

    * Host allow-list (A2): no surprise CDN substitution
    * Symlink/TOCTOU guard (A9): can't trick a privileged write
    * Streaming size caps (A11): can't fill the disk

This file closes the remaining gap — *integrity*. The attacks A1 is
designed to defeat are:

    1. **DNS hijack of a GitHub release.** An attacker who controls
       upstream DNS (or a rogue resolver in a corporate network) can
       point ``raw.githubusercontent.com`` at their own server. TLS
       proves the IP you connected to served a certificate for that
       host — it does NOT prove the content is the file the upstream
       maintainer published. A valid TLS handshake to a hostile origin
       is exactly what a DNS hijack delivers.

    2. **Compromised package CDN.** Even GitHub itself has had blob
       caching incidents. A poisoned cache entry would serve a
       tampered binary over a valid TLS connection from the legitimate
       host. The host allow-list (A2) is no defence here because the
       host IS the canonical host.

    3. **MITM with stolen leaf cert.** A certificate transparency log
       miss combined with a stolen wildcard cert lets an attacker
       intercept ``*.githubusercontent.com`` end-to-end. Rare, but
       part of the threat model for binaries that get system-level
       execute privilege.

    4. **Upstream account takeover.** Whoever has the
       ``datadrivenconstruction`` GitHub credentials can replace
       ``*Exporter.exe`` in the repo, and the host allow-list will
       happily download the new (poisoned) file. The signing key is
       held *separately* from the GitHub credentials — see "Signing
       ceremony" below — so an account takeover is not enough to land
       a hostile converter on user machines.

TLS alone is insufficient because it authenticates the *connection*,
not the *artifact*. Code signing authenticates the *artifact*,
independent of how it was transported. That's what this module does.

================================================================================
DESIGN
================================================================================

We fetch a small JSON ``manifest.json`` that lists every component the
installer can install, with:

    * Platform-specific download URLs
    * SHA-256 hash of the expected file contents
    * File size (cross-check + UX)
    * OE version compatibility range
    * Pinned upstream commit SHA (provenance)

The manifest is paired with a detached Ed25519 signature
(``manifest.json.sig``) created with the project signing key. The
public half of that key is embedded *in this file* (32 bytes hex). At
install time:

    1. Download manifest.json + manifest.json.sig
    2. Verify the signature against the embedded public key
    3. If verify FAILS → refuse (502, do not install)
    4. Look up component + current platform in the parsed manifest
    5. Download the binary
    6. Compute SHA-256 of the downloaded bytes
    7. If hash mismatches manifest → refuse, delete partial file

The escape hatch ``OE_DISABLE_MANIFEST_VERIFY=1`` falls back to the
pre-A1 (A2+A9+A11) flow with a loud WARNING log line. We keep this
escape hatch because dev/CI environments often run against a
not-yet-signed local manifest mirror. Production deployments should
set it to ``0`` (or unset).

For air-gapped sites: ``OE_MANIFEST_URL`` overrides the canonical URL
so operators can host a signed manifest on an internal mirror. The
signature requirement is unchanged — the internal mirror must serve
the upstream-signed bundle as-is.

================================================================================
SIGNING CEREMONY
================================================================================

The private signing key is held by Artem (founder) on a hardware
security key. It is NOT in the repository, NOT in CI secrets, NOT
on any always-on server. Manifest signing happens offline:

    1. Maintainer prepares ``manifest.json`` locally with new SHAs
    2. Plugs in the hardware key
    3. Runs ``scripts/sign_manifest.py manifest.json`` (separate repo)
    4. Uploads ``manifest.json`` + ``manifest.json.sig`` to the CDN
    5. Unplugs the hardware key

If the private key is ever suspected of compromise:

    1. Generate a new keypair (``scripts/rotate_manifest_signing_key.py``
       produces fresh hex pubkey to paste into this file)
    2. Bump ``CURRENT_PUBKEY`` below + ship a patch release
    3. Re-sign all manifests with the new key
    4. Invalidate the old key (push a "revoked" marker so old
       installers refuse to verify against the now-compromised key)

The rotation script writes the new pubkey to *this* source file via
a sentinel marker so the change shows up in a normal code review and
the old key is preserved in git history (for forensic timelines).
