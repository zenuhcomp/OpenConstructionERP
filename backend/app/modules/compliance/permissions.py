"""‌⁠‍Compliance DSL module permission definitions.

A user-authored DSL rule is registered into the global validation engine
and runs against project data — authoring or deleting one is a privileged
action, not something a read-only VIEWER should be able to do. These
permissions gate the write/delete verbs on the rule-builder router. The
read-only natural-language helper endpoints (``from-nl``, ``nl-patterns``,
``validate-syntax``) stay auth-only because they have no side effects.
