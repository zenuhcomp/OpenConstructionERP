"""HSE Advanced cross-module event subscribers (Wave M4 deep-pass).

These handlers wire HSE Advanced to the rest of the platform without
import-time coupling. They are registered idempotently via
:func:`register_subscribers` which is called from
``app.modules.hse_advanced.__init__`` at module-load time.

Subscriptions:

* ``safety.incident.created`` — the base safety module records the
  incident. We re-publish two derived events the platform listens on:

  - ``contracts.risk_register_update`` — risk-register projection (BI / contracts
    risk owners). Even though no canonical RiskRegister table exists today,
    the event is the canonical signal so when contracts grows one it picks
    up the history.
  - ``bi_dashboards.kpi_recompute`` — BI projections (TRIR / LTIFR / days
    without LTI) re-compute for the affected project.

* ``hse.capa.completed`` — when a CAPA closes we likewise nudge BI.

All subscribers are fail-soft — any exception is swallowed at debug.
