"""BIM Hub event handlers — vector indexing for BIM elements.

Subscribes to ``bim_hub.element.*`` events and keeps the
``oe_bim_elements`` vector collection in sync with the underlying
``BIMElement`` rows so semantic search and the per-element "Similar
items" panel always reflect the latest data.

This module is auto-imported by the module loader when the
``oe_bim_hub`` module is loaded (see
``module_loader._load_module`` → ``events.py``).

# Keep the ``oe_bim_elements`` collection in sync with the live
# BIMElement rows.  Each handler opens its own short-lived session,
# eager-loads the parent BIMModel so ``project_id_of`` resolves cleanly,
# and forwards the row to the adapter.  Failures are logged and
# swallowed — vector indexing is best-effort and must never break a
# normal CRUD path.
