"""File References module.

Two responsibilities sharing one table-prefix:

* **ISO 19650 naming validation** — checks a filename against the
  ``Project-Originator-Volume-Level-Type-Role-Number[-Status][-Revision]``
  rule set and persists per-file violations so the file manager can
  surface a "fix me" banner.

* **Cross-entity linking** — a generic many-to-one anchor that lets a
  file (any file_kind) be referenced from an RFI / Issue / Task /
  Submittal etc. The "Referenced in N RFIs" chip in the file preview
  pane is backed by this table.

Both surfaces share the module so the same permission cluster gates
naming sweeps and linking flows.
