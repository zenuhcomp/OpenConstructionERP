"""‌⁠‍Architecture Map module permission definitions.

The architecture manifest leaks substantial structural detail about the
deployed system — every module's file list, every ORM model + table name +
column types, inter-module dependency edges. That is gold for an attacker
mapping an unknown ERP instance ("which models exist? which routes
deserve probing?") and adds nothing for an estimator / project manager
doing day-to-day cost work.

Therefore the entire surface is gated to ``architecture.read`` at
``Role.ADMIN``. Developers and ops staff (the actual audience for the
interactive map) already hold admin or can be granted the permission
without widening any other gate.
