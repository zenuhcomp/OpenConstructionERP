"""‌⁠‍QMS cross-module event subscribers.

These handlers wire QMS to other modules without creating import-time
coupling. They are registered idempotently via :func:`register_subscribers`
which is called from ``app.modules.qms.__init__`` at module-load time.

Subscriptions:

* ``hse.capa.completed`` whose ``source_type=="incident"`` →  mirror the
  HSE incident as a QMS NCR with severity inherited from the CAPA payload
  and ``cost_impact_amount`` carried across when present. This satisfies
  the "HSE NCR auto-mirrored as QMS NCR" requirement.
* ``daily_diary.workforce.summary`` → currently a no-op telemetry hook;
  the ``resources`` module subscribes elsewhere to fold the counts into
  utilisation. Logged here for tracing.
