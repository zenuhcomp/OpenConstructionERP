"""Background jobs for the file_trash module.

This module ships two entry points:

* :func:`register_jobs` — registers a 24-hour periodic task with the
  process-wide asyncio scheduler. ``app.main`` calls this once at
  startup. The function is idempotent — calling it twice silently
  no-ops on the second call.
* :func:`run_purge_once` — single-shot wrapper around
  :func:`purge_expired_trash` that opens its own short-lived session
  so it can be invoked from a Celery worker or a one-off CLI command
  without an outer SQLAlchemy context.

The 24-hour cadence matches the rest of the maintenance schedulers in
``app/main.py`` (KPI recalculation, reports). The first tick fires one
hour after process start so a brand-new install doesn't immediately
hammer the trash table.

Wiring point (already done in ``app/main.py``):

    from app.modules.file_trash.jobs import register_jobs
    register_jobs()  # called from the same startup block that wires
                     # KPI auto-recalculation, reports schedules etc.
