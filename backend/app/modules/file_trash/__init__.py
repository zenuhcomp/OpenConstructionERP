"""File Recycle Bin (soft-delete) module.

Centralised trash table that snapshots a deleted row from any of the
8 file-kind tables. Avoids adding a ``deleted_at`` column to each
kind table (which would touch every existing model). Instead each
deleted row dumps its full payload into ``oe_file_trash.payload_json``
and the original row is removed. Restore re-inserts via the
appropriate kind repository.
