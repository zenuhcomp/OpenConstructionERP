"""Daily Diary cross-module event subscribers (Wave M4 deep-pass).

Wires diary close-out + signature into:

* ``schedule_advanced.actuals_update`` — last-planner actuals tick.
* ``bi_dashboards.kpi_recompute`` — project performance dashboards
  pick up the new contemporaneous record bundle.

Both follow-on events are published with the same diary payload so
downstream consumers can choose what to fold in. The SCL Protocol's
contemporary-record requirement is honoured by the upstream
``daily_diary.signed`` event (the signed payload is sealed before the
event fires); these handlers do not modify diary contents.
