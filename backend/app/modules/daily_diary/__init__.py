"""Daily Site Diary module.

Legally significant daily site diary that aggregates weather snapshots,
visitor/delivery/event/completion entries, photo + video timelines,
drone surveys, reality-capture datasets, and an immutable signed archive
(SHA-256 content hash + signature payload).

Subscriber stubs for upstream auto-populate from HSE/Procurement/
Quality/Schedule are out of scope of the initial backend; the service
exposes ``auto_populate_entries_from_module_events`` as a pure helper
ready to plug into a subscriber.
