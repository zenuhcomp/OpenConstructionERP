"""‌⁠‍CAD/BIM file import via DDC Community converters.

Workflow:
1. User uploads .rvt/.ifc/.dwg/.dgn file
2. Backend saves to temp dir
3. Runs appropriate DDC converter (.exe) -> produces Excel
4. Parses Excel -> extracts elements (type, volume, area, count)
5. AI maps elements to construction work items with pricing

#          `pkg.datadrivenconstruction.io`. The .deb packages
