"""BOQ importer Protocol + transport dataclasses.

Defines the contract every BOQ importer must satisfy:

1. ``detect(head_bytes, filename) -> bool`` — cheap, magic-byte/extension
   sniff against the first ~4 KB of the upload. Must NEVER raise; must
   NEVER read past the supplied head bytes.
2. ``parse(content, *, locale='en') -> ImportedBOQ`` — full parse. May
   raise ``ImportError`` (we re-export :class:`ImporterParseError`) to
   surface a user-safe 400.

The dispatcher route is free to persist the returned positions via
``BOQService.add_position``; importers themselves are pure (no DB I/O),
which keeps them testable in isolation against synthetic fixtures.

Every importer also advertises:

* ``format_id`` — stable identifier (``"gaeb_xml"``, ``"bc3"``, ``"excel"``).
* ``extensions`` — tuple of lowercased extensions (``(".xlsx", ".csv")``).
* ``display_name`` — i18n-key-friendly human label.
* ``rule_packs`` — validation rule packs to fire after import (e.g.
  ``("gaeb", "din276", "boq_quality")``). The dispatcher unions this
  with the project's configured ``REGION_RULES`` so DACH projects still
  pick up DIN 276 on an Excel import.
