"""‌⁠‍Pipeline Builder module.

A thin orchestration layer that turns the platform's existing async
``JobRun`` runner, validation engine and per-module services into a
user-authored, gate-able node DAG. Phase 1 ships the smallest spine that
proves the whole flow end-to-end:

    trigger.manual → source.boq → gate.validation → action.export.excel

See the internal pipeline design notes for the canonical
design (the module deliberately reuses, never reinvents, infrastructure).
