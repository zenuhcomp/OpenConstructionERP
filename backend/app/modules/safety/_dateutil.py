"""‌⁠‍Defensive date parsing/normalisation for the safety module.

``SafetyIncident.incident_date`` is stored as a ``String`` column (no schema
migration is in scope to change that). The API layer enforces a strict
``YYYY-MM-DD`` pattern, but direct service callers, importers (GAEB/Excel),
and legacy rows can still introduce non-canonical strings.

A *wrong* safety number is dangerous: if a malformed stored date were silently
dropped from the "days without incident / LTI" computation, a project with a
real recent incident could falsely read as "no incidents" (reassuring blank)
or a huge "all good" number. These helpers therefore:

* parse the canonical ISO form *and* a small set of unambiguous fallbacks;
* report unparseable values to the caller (so the metric can fail safe toward
  "cannot confirm" instead of a falsely-reassuring value);
* canonicalise on write so future rows are always clean ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD``.
