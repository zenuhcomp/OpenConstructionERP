"""‌⁠‍Teams service — business logic for team management.

Stateless service layer. Handles:
- Team CRUD within projects
- Membership management (add / remove / list)
- Entity visibility grants

Authorisation model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Team membership is the seed of permission inheritance: a user added to a
team inherits whatever effective permissions that team grants on the
parent project. That makes ``add_member`` (and to a lesser degree
``create_team`` / ``update_team`` / ``remove_member``) RBAC-sensitive —
we MUST gate them on project ownership / admin status so a low-privilege
user cannot self-elevate by joining a high-permission team.

Elevated team roles (``owner`` / ``project_manager``) carry full
write-on-project semantics in the matrix UI, so they're restricted to
project-owners and system admins regardless of who is making the call.
