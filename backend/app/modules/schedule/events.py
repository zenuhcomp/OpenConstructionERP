"""‌⁠‍Schedule event handlers — bridge field reports into the 4D progress log.

Subscribes to ``fieldreports.report.submitted`` and converts each
``schedule_progress`` payload entry into a :class:`ScheduleProgressEntry`
via :class:`ScheduleProgressService`. Closes the workflow gap where a
foreman would mark "Activity 12 → 70%" on a field report and the
schedule module showed it stuck at 0% because nothing copied the value
across.

Module is auto-imported by the module loader when ``oe_schedule`` is
loaded (see ``module_loader._load_module`` → ``events.py``).

Idempotency
-----------
``ScheduleProgressEntry`` is append-only — re-firing the event WILL
record additional history rows. We de-duplicate at the application
boundary by stamping each accepted entry's ``metadata.report_id`` on
the activity itself; subsequent fires for the same (report, task) pair
short-circuit. This keeps the audit log honest without losing real
duplicate-submit incidents.

Failure mode
------------
Errors are logged and swallowed — the field-report submission must not
fail because the schedule integration choked. Foreman → progress is
already best-effort once it leaves the truck.
