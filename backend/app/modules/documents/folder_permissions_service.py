"""Folder-permission service — grant / revoke / effective-permissions API.

Stateless functions mirroring :mod:`app.modules.documents.share_service`.

Public surface
--------------
* :func:`grant_permission` — owner mints a viewer/editor/owner grant.
  Maps unique-constraint violations to HTTP 409 so the UI can show a
  meaningful "already granted" message instead of a generic 500.
* :func:`revoke_permission` — owner hard-revokes by primary key
  (soft-flips ``revoked``). The grant survives so a future audit
  endpoint can replay history.
* :func:`list_permissions` — owner-only inventory for the modal.
* :func:`effective_permissions_for` — what a non-owner user can see
  on a given project. Returns a dict keyed by ``(scope_kind,
  scope_path)`` → role string. Includes wildcard (``scope_path is None``)
  grants. The router uses this to filter ``list_documents`` and to
  enforce read/write on ``get_document`` / ``delete_document``.
* :func:`restricted_scopes_for_project` — the set of
  ``(scope_kind, scope_path)`` tuples that have **any** non-revoked
  grant on the project. Used by the router to decide whether an
  unscoped folder is still "open to all members" or has become
  restricted.
* :func:`folder_access_for` — high-level convenience used by the
  document endpoints: given a user + project + ``(kind, path)`` it
  returns the effective role (or ``None`` for "no access"). Folds the
  "owner bypass", "unscoped folder is open" and "grant required"
  branches together so the routers stay simple.

Why a service module instead of a repository?
    The data shape is two queries deep (grants table joined to
    projects + users). Splitting into models / schemas / service keeps
    the router thin and the test surface small without adding a
    dedicated repository class — the queries are short enough.
