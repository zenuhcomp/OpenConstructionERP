"""Buyer self-service portal — JWT magic-link service.

This module implements the buyer-facing portal that NEVER authenticates
through the internal JWT auth (buyers have no internal accounts). The
flow is:

1. A sales-manager (internal user) creates a Reservation / SalesContract
   for a Buyer. The UI offers an "Issue buyer access link" action which
   calls :meth:`PortalLinkService.issue_token`.
2. ``issue_token`` mints a JWT with ``scope='portal'`` and persists the
   ``jti`` on :class:`oe_propdev_portal_token` for audit + revocation.
   The full URL ``{frontend_origin}/buyer-portal/{token}`` is emailed
   to the buyer (out of scope for this service — caller handles email).
3. The buyer opens the link. Frontend hits ``POST /verify/`` which
   decodes the JWT, looks up the ``jti`` row, rejects revoked /
   expired / wrong-scope tokens, and returns buyer summary.
4. Every subsequent buyer call (``/overview/``, ``/documents/...``,
   ``/upload-kyc/``, ``/contact-agent/``) goes through
   :meth:`PortalLinkService.resolve_token_for_buyer_access` which
   re-runs the verify + records ``last_used_at`` / ``last_used_ip``.

Design notes:

* The token is stateless on the wire (JWT-signed with ``JWT_SECRET``)
  so verify is fast and doesn't need a DB round-trip for the crypto
  check. The DB lookup is then ONLY for the revocation list + audit
  trail — adding a single ``SELECT WHERE jwt_id = ?`` per request,
  always satisfied by the unique index on ``jwt_id``.
* The ``scope='portal'`` claim is mandatory. The existing R5 token
  ``decode_access_token`` rejects portal tokens for internal endpoints
  by requiring ``type='access'``; this module mirrors that by checking
  ``scope='portal'`` here. A leaked internal access token cannot pivot
  into a portal token and vice-versa.
* Money / payment-schedule reads happen at the service layer; IDOR
  guards live in the router (where the buyer's UUID is known).
