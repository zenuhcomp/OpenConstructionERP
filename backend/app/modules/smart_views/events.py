"""‌⁠‍Smart Views event subscribers — cross-module visibility refresh.

This module is auto-imported by ``module_loader`` when ``oe_smart_views``
loads (see ``core/module_loader.py:_load_module`` → ``events.py``).

Background — issue #103 (federation visibility staleness on owner change)
==========================================================================

A SmartView's *visibility* is derived, not stored:

* ``user`` scope    — owner is implicit (``created_by`` = ``scope_id``).
* ``project`` scope — readable to whoever can read the project, which
  in the current model is the project's owner. Change the project owner
  and the readable-by set flips overnight.
* ``federation`` scope — same, transitively (federation → project →
  owner).

The CRUD path now emits ``smart_views.visibility_changed`` on every
create / update / delete / share / revoke (see ``service.py``), but
owner changes happen *outside* this module — they land as a
``projects.project.updated`` event. Without the subscriber below the
BIM viewer's SmartViews dropdown would keep listing the previous owner's
views until the user hard-refreshed.

We forward a single ``smart_views.visibility_changed`` event so any
downstream cache (sidebar badges, viewer dropdown, federation hub) can
key off one consistent event name regardless of the trigger.

    not affect SmartView visibility and we skip the DB roundtrip.

    For each affected SmartView (project-scoped + federation-scoped
    under the project) we publish one event carrying the new owner so
    caches keyed by ``(view_id, viewer_id)`` can self-invalidate.
