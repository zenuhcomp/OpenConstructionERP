"""‌⁠‍CWICR Qdrant adapter — 30-collection multilingual cost-rate search.

Replaces the legacy ``vector_adapter`` (LanceDB + e5-small + 384-dim) for
the ``/match-elements`` path. The new pipeline holds rate vectors in
30 per-language Qdrant collections (``cwicr_<lang>``), each point
carrying three named vectors:

* ``dense``     — 1024-dim BAAI/bge-m3 of the full rate description.
* ``sparse``    — BM25-like inverted vector for verbatim term hits
                  (concrete grades, pipe nominals, bolt sizes, etc).
* ``resources`` — 1024-dim bge-m3 of the rate's top-12 unique resources.

The Qdrant payload is intentionally minimal — only keys plus filter
columns (``rate_code``, ``country``, ``department_code``, ``is_abstract``,
``rate_unit``, ``mass_*``). Heavy fields (prices, labor lines, full
resource list, budget sums — 84 columns total) are read on demand from
``<region>_workitems_costs_resources_DDC_CWICR.parquet`` via
:mod:`app.modules.costs.parquet_lookup`. Keeping the vector store narrow
keeps embedded-Qdrant disk usage manageable and lets the parquet column
set evolve without re-vectorising.

Contract
--------

This module exposes two async helpers:

* :func:`search` — one-shot hybrid search that fans out
  ``dense`` + ``sparse`` (+ optional ``resources``) prefetches and fuses
  them with Reciprocal Rank Fusion natively in the Qdrant Query API.
* :func:`lookup_full_rows` — proxy onto :mod:`parquet_lookup` so the
  ranker can stay on a single ``qdrant_adapter`` import.

Heavy imports (``qdrant_client``, ``FlagEmbedding``) are deferred to the
function body. The module is safe to import even when the optional
``[semantic]`` extra is missing — only the CWICR Qdrant path degrades,
the rest of the app keeps booting.

Deployment
----------

Two modes are supported:

* **Server** (recommended for production and for DDC's pre-built
  catalogues) — ``settings.cwicr_qdrant_url`` points at a real Qdrant
  server (Docker compose ships ``qdrant/qdrant:v1.12.5`` on ports
  6333/6334). This is the **only** mode that can ingest the v3
  snapshots DDC publishes (``*_EMBEDDINGS_BGEM3_V3_DDC_CWICR.snapshot``)
  via :meth:`QdrantClient.recover_snapshot`. Verified 2026-05-09: the
  embedded path errors with ``NotImplementedError: Snapshots are not
  supported in the local Qdrant``, see v3 plan §5 risk note.
* **Embedded** (development / smoke) — ``settings.cwicr_qdrant_path``
  spawns an in-process simulation via ``QdrantClient(path=...)``.
  Suitable when the caller vectorises rates locally with BGE-M3 and
  upserts them point-by-point. **Cannot** ingest DDC snapshots.

The adapter prefers ``url`` over ``path`` when both are configured.
``settings.cwicr_qdrant_path`` defaults to ``~/.openestimator/qdrant_cwicr/``.

# ISO-639-1 language code of the rates inside. One collection per
# language — Mexico, Spain and Argentina catalogues all live in
# ``cwicr_es_v3`` because BGE-M3 multilingual benefits from same-language
# clustering, and per-country narrowing is done via the ``country``
# payload predicate (see :func:`country_filter_for`).
#
# Pre-v3 (LanceDB era) we used ``cwicr_<country>`` with a hand-rolled
# remap table for USA→us / GB→uk. The v3 layout makes the remap
# unnecessary — :func:`region_language.language_for` already returns
# ``"en"`` for both USA_USD and GB_LONDON, so they correctly land in
# ``cwicr_en_v3`` together.
#
# Schema version is overridable via ``settings.cwicr_collection_version``

# change. Empty string strips the suffix entirely for legacy installs

    When the language-derived collection (e.g. ``cwicr_pt_v3`` for a

    circuited every BIM-vs-cost match to ``catalog_not_vectorized`` and

    the vector-count probe and the search itself because both route

    down-state empty UI still fires.

    Enriched-collection routing

    returned name is suffixed with ``_enriched`` (e.g.,
    ``cwicr_en_v3_enriched``). This lets operators A/B against a
    description-rich enrichment built by
    ``scripts/build_enriched_snapshot.py`` without touching the

# A naive ``search()`` against the indexed CWICR collections will under-
# return when the SearchPlan emits too many hard filters at once. The
# fallback ladder, dedup pass, and abstract-substitution step below turn
# the raw Qdrant call into a robust top-K builder for the ranker.
#
# Per MAPPING_PROCESS.md v3 §5.2 the relaxation order trades the most
# specific signals first (``ifc_predefined_type``, ``construction_stage``)
# and keeps the bedrock predicates (``country``, ``unit_dim``,
# ``ifc_class``, ``is_abstract=False``) until last — those define the
# "this rate is in the right ballpark" baseline. The Pset booleans are
# dropped together because they are highly correlated and dropping just
# one rarely opens a meaningful new candidate set.

# Filter keys removed at each tier — earlier tiers preserve more
# specificity, later tiers progressively strip down to the bedrock.
# A ``None`` entry means "no relaxation" (final tier yields the full
# original filter set).

    3. Single Qdrant scroll on ``country_to_collection(target_country)``
       with ``MatchAny`` on ``rate_code`` — at most one round-trip.
    4. When the target language collection mixes regions (ES collection
       carries ES + MX + AR), narrow further with the
       :func:`country_filter_for` predicate so the lookup honours the
       caller's region pin.

    Returns the matching ``rate_code`` string when found, else ``None``.
    Defensive: degrades to ``None`` on any Qdrant error / missing extras

    Section headers (e.g., DIN 276 KG-330 "Außenwände") are valuable
    semantically — the dense vector hits them when the query is broad —
    but worthless as cost rates because they have no unit price. v3
    indexes them with ``is_abstract=True`` so the ranker can spot them
    and issue a narrow follow-up search constrained to the same
    ``department_code`` / ``subsection_code`` with ``is_abstract=False``.

    Only the top ``max_substitutions`` abstract hits trigger follow-ups
    so the latency cost stays bounded (each follow-up is one Qdrant
    Query API call). Concrete children are spliced in at the abstract
    parent's original rank position; their order among themselves is
    the RRF order returned by the follow-up call.

    Hits without an abstract row pass through unchanged.
