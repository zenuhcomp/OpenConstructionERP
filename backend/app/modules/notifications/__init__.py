    Three things happen on boot:

    1. ``register_notification_subscribers()`` wires every cross-module
       mutation event (rfi.assigned, boq.boq.created, …) into the
       in-app notification service.

    2. ``register_dispatchers()`` (Epic B / B2) attaches the real email
       + webhook sinks to ``notifications.dispatch.email`` and
       ``notifications.dispatch.webhook`` — pre-Epic-B these channels
       silently dropped because nothing subscribed.

    3. ``start_scheduler()`` (Epic B / B4-B5) starts the in-process
       periodic worker that flushes the digest queue every 5 minutes
       and cleans up aged notifications every 24 hours.
