"""File Saved Views module — Smart Folders for /files.

A saved view is a named, serialized snapshot of the file-manager
filter state (kind, search query, sort, extension, tags, date range,
custom keys). Users open ``/files`` with one click and the filter is
re-applied — equivalent to a personal smart-folder.

Views can be pinned, reordered, duplicated and (optionally) shared
with the whole project team. Per-user, per-project scope, with a
nullable ``project_id`` reserved for global views that span all
projects the user can access.
