        Performance: pushes the scan into the database as a single
        ``SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTR(project_code, N) AS INTEGER))`` aggregate
        scoped by ``LIKE prefix || '%'``. Previously this method loaded
        every matching row into the application and iterated in Python —
        an O(n) pull that became measurable past a few hundred projects.
        The aggregate runs in O(1) wall time on the indexed column with
        a single round-trip and zero rows transferred.

        ``GLOB`` (SQLite) / ``SIMILAR TO`` (Postgres) would be the
        absolutely safest filter for the cast, but neither is portable.
        Instead we feed the cast a substring that's already been
        prefix-matched, then defensively coalesce a ``NULL`` MAX (no
        rows) to ``None``. Rows whose suffix isn't a pure integer don't
        produce a meaningful ``int(...)`` in the old code path either —
        on SQLite the cast yields ``0`` for them (harmless: 0 < any real
        sequence), on Postgres the cast raises and we fall through to the
        Python scan as a safety net (preserves existing semantics for
