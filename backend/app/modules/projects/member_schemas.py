"""Project Member API schemas.

The Team Strip on ProjectDetailPage works at the project level rather than the
fine-grained ``Team`` level. Internally each project gets a "Default Team"
on creation (see ``ProjectService.create_project``); these schemas describe the
project-member contract exposed at ``/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/members/``.

Each ``ProjectMemberResponse`` is a denormalised view of a row in
``oe_teams_membership`` joined to ``oe_users_user`` so the frontend can render
avatar circles (initials + tooltip) without a second roundtrip.
