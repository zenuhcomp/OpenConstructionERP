"""‌⁠‍ERP Chat module permission definitions (T8).

Adds an ``erp_chat.admin`` permission gating the new admin observability
endpoint. Read-side ``erp_chat.use`` is implied by anyone with editor or
higher and isn't enforced today (the streaming endpoint just needs an
authenticated user), so we don't register that explicitly to avoid
breaking the existing JWT-only path.
