"""‌⁠‍Risk event handlers — vector indexing for lessons-learned reuse.

Subscribes to ``risk.risk.*`` events and keeps the ``oe_risks`` vector
collection in sync with the underlying :class:`RiskItem` rows.  Risks
have the **highest cross-project semantic-search value** of any module —
an estimator on a new project wants to instantly pull up "similar risks
we already faced" across the entire tenant history so they can reuse the
mitigation strategy, contingency plan and budget reserve.

This module is auto-imported by the module loader when the ``oe_risk``
module is loaded (see ``module_loader._load_module`` → ``events.py``).
