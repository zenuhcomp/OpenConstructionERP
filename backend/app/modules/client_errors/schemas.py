"""Pydantic schemas for the client-error sink endpoint.

The payload mirrors the anonymised entry produced by
``frontend/src/shared/lib/errorLogger.ts`` — emails, UUIDs, API keys,
bearer tokens, long numeric ids, and well-known PII JSON fields are
already scrubbed client-side before the POST is fired.

We enforce hard caps on every string field so a misbehaving client (or
an attacker bypassing the client-side scrub) cannot drive arbitrarily
large lines into the log pipeline.
