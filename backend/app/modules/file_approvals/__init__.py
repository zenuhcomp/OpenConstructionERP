"""File Approval Workflows + Stamps module (Wave W8).

A user submits a file for approval → a workflow with N ordered steps is
created → each approver records a decision → on final approval, the
configured stamp template is "burned" into a copy of the artifact:

* For PDFs, ``pypdf`` overlays a stamp page (when available).
* For everything else (or when ``pypdf`` is absent), a sidecar JSON
  file is written next to the canonical name describing the stamp.
