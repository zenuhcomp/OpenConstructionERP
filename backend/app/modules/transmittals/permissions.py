"""Transmittals module permission definitions.

Wave-5 audit (2026-05-28) discovered the router declares
``RequirePermission("transmittals.{read|create|update|delete}")`` but the
module never registered the permissions with the live permission
registry, so all non-admin roles received 403 with a stray
"Unknown permission checked" WARN. Admins succeeded only via the role
bypass. This file ships the missing registration; semantics mirror the
neighbouring document-flow modules (submittals, correspondence).
