"""Deterministic-mode helpers for the match pipeline.

Background
==========

The match pipeline mixes several stochastic surfaces:

1. **BGE-M3 bi-encoder** — encodes the query text. ``FlagEmbedding`` runs
   the forward pass in mini-batches; the batch composition is fixed for
   a single ``encode([text])`` call BUT torch op dispatch (specifically
   matmul kernel selection on x86 BLAS) is allowed to vary across
   process boots, producing 1e-5–1e-4 numeric drift in the dense vector.
2. **BGE cross-encoder rerank** — ``FlagReranker.compute_score(pairs)``
   batches pairs together. Batch grouping changes which floating-point
   ops accumulate first, shifting per-pair scores by ε amounts that flip
   tie-breaks at the boundary of the top-k.
3. **Qdrant HNSW** — the underlying ANN graph is deterministic within a
   collection BUT named-vector RRF fusion ties (where dense rank == sparse
   rank for two candidates) resolve by an internal insertion order that
   depends on parallel-fetch completion timing across the two prefetch
   queries.
4. **Result sorts** — several internal sorts use ``key=lambda c: c.score``
   without a tie-break. When two candidates land on the same fused score
   (very common at the v3 cosine collapse band ≈ 0.001–0.04), Python's
   stable sort preserves their input order — which is itself a function
   of (1)–(3).

This module concentrates the fixes so a future maintainer reviewing
"why is determinism still broken on my fork" has one file to read.

Activation
==========

``OE_MATCH_DETERMINISTIC=1`` enables the full pin set at process boot.
Without it the matcher behaves exactly as before. Set to:

    * ``1`` / ``true``  — pin RNGs to ``OE_MATCH_SEED`` (default 42),
                           force BGE batch_size=1, install stable post-sort.
    * unset / ``0``     — production path. No pinning.

The mode is **OFF in production by default** — pinning batch_size=1
costs ~3× on the rerank stage and torch's deterministic kernel set is
slower for the bi-encoder too. Bench runs flip it on for reproducibility.

Why ``OE_MATCH_SEED`` is process-wide, not per-request
======================================================

Setting per-request seeds derived from ``(project_id, session_id)``
would in theory let production traffic stay deterministic per-user
while still getting reproducible bench runs. We don't do that because:

1. BGE encoder forward passes share GPU/CPU state across calls — once
   one request taints the CUDA generator state mid-pass, the next
   request's "fresh seed" can't undo it without a full GPU sync.
2. The cost is wrong anyway: production wants the natural variance of
   floating-point accumulation order across batches as a free
   regularizer; pinning it gives up that benefit.

The bench harness sets the seed once at backend boot via env var; the
pipeline reads it inside ``enter_deterministic_mode()`` on first call.

    Idempotent — first call seeds, subsequent calls return the active

    is not enabled by env var, so callers can use the return value as a
    cheap probe ("was anything pinned?").

    Pins applied (in order, fail-soft):

    1. Python ``random.seed(seed)``.
    2. ``numpy.random.seed(seed)`` (no-op when numpy isn't installed).
    3. ``torch.manual_seed(seed)`` (no-op when torch isn't installed).
    4. ``torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)`` when CUDA is available.
    5. ``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True, warn_only=True)`` —
       ``warn_only`` is important: some kernels (e.g. scaled_dot_product
       attention's flash-attn backend) raise without it, killing the
       request rather than degrading gracefully.
    6. ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8`` — required for deterministic
       cuBLAS matmul; harmless on CPU.
    7. Monkeypatch ``FlagReranker.compute_score`` and
       ``BGEM3FlagModel.encode`` to force ``batch_size=1`` so batch
       composition doesn't shift floating-point accumulation order.
