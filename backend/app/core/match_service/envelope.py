"""Universal request/response types for the element-to-CWICR matcher.

Every source pipeline (BIM, PDF, DWG, photo) feeds the same
:class:`ElementEnvelope` into the matcher. The envelope is intentionally
loose-typed (``properties`` and ``quantities`` are free-form dicts) so a
new source extractor can ship without touching this schema.

Response candidates carry both the raw cosine score and the boosted
final score so the UI can show "why" each candidate ranks where it
does (the ``boosts_applied`` dict).

    The envelope captures everything the matcher needs to rank CWICR
    candidates: a free-form description, source language, optional
    quantitative properties and pre-classification hints from the
    upstream extractor.

    Attributes:
        source: Which pipeline produced this element.
        source_lang: ISO-639 two-letter code (e.g. ``"en"``, ``"de"``).
            The matcher translates the description into the project's
            ``target_language`` before searching.
        category: Free-form element type (e.g. ``"wall"``, ``"door"``,
            ``"hvac_duct"``). Used in query construction and boost
            heuristics.
        description: Human-readable summary the matcher embeds.
        properties: Material, fire-rating, finish, etc. Stringified into
            the query text but kept in raw form so boosts can see them.
        quantities: ``length_m`` / ``area_m2`` / ``volume_m3`` / etc.
            Used to infer the expected unit when ``unit_hint`` is absent.
        unit_hint: Preferred CWICR unit (``"m"``, ``"m2"``, ``"m3"``,
            ``"pcs"``). When present, drives the unit boost.
        classifier_hint: ``{"din276": "330.10", "masterformat": "..."}``.
            BIM elements typically arrive pre-classified; PDF/photo
            usually don't.
