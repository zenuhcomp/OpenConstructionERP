"""‌⁠‍Universal request/response types for the element-to-CWICR matcher.

Every source pipeline (BIM, PDF, DWG, photo) feeds the same
:class:`ElementEnvelope` into the matcher. The envelope is intentionally
loose-typed (``properties`` and ``quantities`` are free-form dicts) so a
new source extractor can ship without touching this schema.

Response candidates carry both the raw cosine score and the boosted
final score so the UI can show "why" each candidate ranks where it
does (the ``boosts_applied`` dict).

class ElementEnvelope(BaseModel):
    """‌⁠‍Source-agnostic representation of one estimable element.

    The envelope captures everything the matcher needs to rank CWICR
    candidates: a free-form description, source language, optional
    quantitative properties and pre-classification hints from the
    upstream extractor.

    Attributes:
        source: Which pipeline produced this element.
        source_lang: ISO-639 two-letter code (e.g. ``"en"``, ``"de"``).
            The matcher translates the description into the project's
            ``target_language`` before searching.
        category: Free-form element type (e.g. ``"wall"``, ``"door"``,
            ``"hvac_duct"``). Used in query construction and boost
            heuristics.
        description: Human-readable summary the matcher embeds.
        properties: Material, fire-rating, finish, etc. Stringified into
            the query text but kept in raw form so boosts can see them.
        quantities: ``length_m`` / ``area_m2`` / ``volume_m3`` / etc.
            Used to infer the expected unit when ``unit_hint`` is absent.
        unit_hint: Preferred CWICR unit (``"m"``, ``"m2"``, ``"m3"``,
            ``"pcs"``). When present, drives the unit boost.
        classifier_hint: ``{"din276": "330.10", "masterformat": "..."}``.
            BIM elements typically arrive pre-classified; PDF/photo
            usually don't.

    v3 ProjectItem fields (added 2026-05-09 per MAPPING_PROCESS.md §3.2):
    upstream extractors that know the structured value should populate
    these fields directly. The query builder routes them to either
    Qdrant ``hard_filters`` or ``soft_boosts`` based on the
    "if classifier errs, would the right answer be discarded?" rule
    from §4.2.1 — BIM Pset values are hard, DWG / heuristic guesses
    are soft. Each is optional so existing callers don't break.

    Attributes (v3):
        ifc_class: Verbatim ``IfcWall`` / ``IfcSlab`` / ``IfcBeam`` from
            the BIM extractor. Hard filter when present — IFC class is
            authoritative for source-of-truth IFC files.
        ifc_predefined_type: ``"PARTITIONING"``, ``"FLOOR"``, etc.
            Hard filter when present.
        ost_category: Revit ``OST_Walls`` / ``OST_Floors`` from the
            Revit RVT export. Soft boost — Revit families occasionally
            mislabel category vs ifc_class.
        material_class: Normalised material bucket — ``"concrete"``,
            ``"steel"``, ``"wood"``, ``"ceramic"``. Soft boost.
        nominal_size_mm: Integer mm thickness / diameter / nominal size.
            Soft boost — sized rates within ±10% range still rank well.
        is_external: Pset ``IsExternal`` — hard filter when present
            (BIM Pset is trustworthy).
        is_loadbearing: Pset ``LoadBearing`` — hard filter when present.
        is_structural: ``StructuralUsage == "Bearing"`` from Revit —
            hard filter when present.
        construction_stage_hint: User-picked stage (``"02_Demolition"``
            … ``"13_Sitework"``). Hard filter when present — the user
            explicitly narrowed the search.
