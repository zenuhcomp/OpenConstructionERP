"""‌⁠‍Match service — element-to-CWICR vector matcher.

Public API:

    * :func:`match_element` — eval-harness entrypoint:
        ``async (element_info: dict, top_k: int) -> list[dict]``.
        Wraps ``build_envelope`` + ``rank``. Each returned dict
        carries at minimum ``code`` and ``unit_rate`` (the eval
        contract).
    * :func:`match_envelope` — when the caller already built an
        :class:`ElementEnvelope` (typically the router).
    * :func:`record_feedback` — persist user confirmation/rejection
        for offline boost-weight tuning.

Source extractors live under ``extractors/`` and self-register via
:data:`extractors.EXTRACTORS`.

Boost rules live under ``boosts/`` and self-register via
:data:`boosts.BOOSTS`.

Configuration knobs live in :mod:`config`.

    The harness signature passes only positional ``element_info`` and
    ``top_k`` — every other argument is keyword-only with a sensible
    default so the call surface stays simple for that runner.

    Source resolution:
        * Explicit ``source`` keyword if provided.
        * ``element_info["source"]`` otherwise.
        * Falls back to ``"bim"`` (the most common case in our golden
          set).

    Project resolution:
        * Explicit ``project_id`` keyword if provided.
        * ``element_info["project_id"]`` otherwise.
        * Falls back to a sentinel UUID so the matcher can still build
