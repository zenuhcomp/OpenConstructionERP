"""‌⁠‍Actor / capture-context middleware for Epic H universal audit trail.

Sets the per-request :class:`~app.core.audit_log.AuditContext` on a
ContextVar so :func:`app.core.audit_log.log_activity` can persist the
peer IP, User-Agent, and correlation ID without service-layer callers
having to thread the values manually.

Identity (``actor_id`` / ``tenant_id``) is **not** resolved here —
authentication happens later in the request lifecycle via the
``get_current_user_id`` dependency. The dependency
:func:`app.dependencies.audit_context_dep` enriches the same ContextVar
with the resolved IDs once the request handler runs. The middleware
covers everything that does NOT require auth (peer IP, UA, request-id),
which is enough for the unauthenticated paths (CSRF probe, register,
login) so even those leave a row in ``oe_activity_log``.

Order in the middleware stack: this MUST be installed **after**
:class:`app.middleware.request_id.RequestIDMiddleware` so the
correlation ID is already on the request-id ContextVar when we read it
back here.
