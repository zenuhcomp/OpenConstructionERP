/**
 * Unit tests for the row-level edit / delete handlers in the Resources
 * Assignments tab.
 *
 * The tab itself depends on many sibling features (project context,
 * authentication, useQueries fan-out, etc.) which would each need a
 * non-trivial mock. We instead exercise the leaf behaviours directly:
 *
 *   1. ``deleteAssignment`` issues a DELETE to the right endpoint and
 *      returns ``undefined`` on 204.
 *   2. ``updateAssignment`` PATCHes the same id with the supplied
 *      partial payload and returns the updated row.
 *
 * That covers the critical fix: before this change, the only mutation
 * endpoints called from the page were ``proposeAssignment`` /
 * ``confirmAssignment`` / ``cancelAssignment`` — there were no
 * client-side functions to call PATCH or DELETE on an assignment, so
 * the UI had no way to edit or delete one. The test guarantees the
 * helpers exist, hit the right URL, and round-trip the payload.
