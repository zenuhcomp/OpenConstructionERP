/** PathBar — intentionally hidden.
 *
 * Earlier revisions surfaced the absolute filesystem paths used by the
 * backend (DB / uploads / photos / BIM / DWG) at the top of /files so
 * desktop self-hosters could locate their data on disk.  On hosted
 * deployments that became a privacy/clutter problem — every viewer saw
 * the server's directory layout — so the bar is a no-op.  Users who need
 * the underlying paths can find them in /settings → System.
