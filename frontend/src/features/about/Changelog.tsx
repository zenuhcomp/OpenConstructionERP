      'BIM filter panel — three professional grouping modes via a new segmented control: **By Category** (flat list of every Revit category / IFC entity, default — works for both formats with zero curation), **By Type Name** (hierarchical Category → Family/Type Name like the Revit Browser, with chevron-collapsible category headers), and **Buckets** (existing semantic Structure / Envelope / MEP / … grouping kept as a third option).  Fixes the user complaint that the bucket-only view felt incomplete and unclear about how filters were structured',
      'New `getTypeNameKey()` helper resolves the second-level Type Name from `el.name` first, then `properties.family`, `properties["family and type"]`, or `properties.type`.  Real Revit data has 100% `name` coverage and 75% `properties.family` coverage, so the type-name view always populates',
      'Added explicit "Clear types" link in the type-filter section header (matches the existing "All levels" link in the storey section) so users have a one-click way to drop type selections without re-clicking each chip',
      'Headless test extended (TEST 7d) — verifies all three grouping modes by clicking the segmented control buttons and counting category headers: 127 category headers rendered in Type Name mode on the demo (every distinct element_type gets its own collapsible header).  Screenshots saved at 14-typename-grouping.png and 15-buckets-grouping.png',
      'Headless test fix — TEST 7b\'s modal-close button selector was matching the close button on the BIM filter panel itself (both are X-icon lucide buttons), accidentally closing the panel between tests and breaking TEST 7c.  Scoped the close-button query to elements inside the `.fixed.inset-0.z-50` modal overlay only.  All 10 verdicts now PASS deterministically',

    date: '2026-04-11',
    changes: [
      'Fix: "Add to BOQ" link create returned 500 Internal Server Error on every click. Root cause: the v1.3.22 backend agent\'s ownership check `_verify_boq_position_access()` referenced `position.project_id` directly, but `Position` has no `project_id` column — the project lives on the parent `BOQ` row reached via `position.boq_id`. Fix: rewrote the helper as a single-row SELECT that joins Position → BOQ and pulls `BOQ.project_id` in one round-trip. Verified end-to-end via curl (link created, cad_element_ids synced, boq_links embedded in element response, delete works) and via the headless deep test',
      'Fix: headless test for Save-as-group lifecycle was flaky — the assertion ran 2 s after the POST, but the React Query refetch + panel re-render chain sometimes took longer. Replaced the fixed timeout with a 6-s polling loop that breaks as soon as the saved-groups section appears, eliminating false-negative FAILs',

    changes: [
      'BIM saved groups — full lifecycle UI completed.  v1.3.24 added the SaveGroupModal, but the saved groups had nowhere to live afterwards.  v1.3.25 adds a "Saved groups" section at the top of the BIMFilterPanel scroll area listing every group for the current model with one-click apply, link-to-BOQ, and delete actions.  Each row shows the group\'s color dot, name, and cached member count.  Clicking a group converts its `filter_criteria` back into the panel\'s Set-based filter state and highlights the row as the active group.  Manual filter changes drop the highlight automatically because the filter is no longer 1:1 with the group',
      'BIM saved groups — fetched via `useQuery(["bim-element-groups", projectId, modelId])` from the new `/api/v1/bim_hub/element-groups/` endpoint, with React Query auto-refetch on save / delete via `invalidateQueries`.  Delete uses a confirmation dialog and the new `deleteElementGroup` API wrapper.  Link-to-BOQ resolves the group\'s `member_element_ids` against the loaded element list and opens AddToBOQModal with the resolved subset',
      'Headless deep test (debug-bim.cjs TEST 7c) now exercises the FULL lifecycle: filter Walls → click "Save as group" → type a unique group name → click "Save group" → verify the new SAVED GROUPS section lists it → click Clear all → click the saved group row → verify mesh visibility re-narrows to the original 205 walls → click the trash icon → confirm bypassed → verify the group disappears.  All five sub-assertions PASS — group save → list, group apply, group delete',
      'Test verdict logic — clear-storey now compares against the buildings-only baseline (5168) instead of the raw mesh count (5440), so the previous WARN flips to PASS.  The buildings-only toggle hides 272 noise meshes by default, which is the expected baseline for every filter test',

      'BIM storage architecture — three layers landed end-to-end. (1) Pluggable storage backend abstraction in `app/core/storage.py` with LocalStorageBackend (default, byte-for-byte identical to v1.3.23) and S3StorageBackend (opt-in via `pip install openconstructionerp[s3]`, supports MinIO / AWS / Backblaze / DigitalOcean Spaces). (2) New `oe_bim_element_group` table for saved selections — dynamic groups recompute members from a filter predicate, static groups freeze the snapshot. (3) Full design captured in `docs/BIM-STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` covering the three layers, the cross-module link unification roadmap, and the migration path for existing deployments',
      'BIM Element Groups (saved selections) — backend complete: new `BIMElementGroup` SQLAlchemy model + Pydantic schemas + service methods (list/create/update/delete + resolve_element_group_members) + 4 endpoints under /api/v1/bim_hub/element-groups/ + Alembic migration `f22fa2934807_add_bim_element_group_table`. The resolve method handles all filter_criteria keys (element_type, category, discipline, storey, name_contains, property_filter) with PostgreSQL JSON containment for property matching and a Python-side fallback for SQLite',
      'Frontend element groups UX — new `SaveGroupModal` (~210 lines) opens from a "Save as group" button next to the Quick Takeoff button in the filter panel. Captures the current filter criteria + visible element ids, lets the user pick dynamic vs static, set a name + description + colour, then POSTs to the new endpoint. Verified end-to-end via headless test: button shows when filter is active, click opens modal with header + name input + radio toggles, both screenshot inspection and DOM assertions pass',
      'Storage backend tests — new `backend/tests/unit/test_storage.py` covers LocalStorageBackend round-trip (write → read → verify → delete → verify gone) and the storage factory (settings → correct backend instance). Both tests pass cleanly with `pytest tests/unit/test_storage.py -v`',
      'Storage migration helper — new `backend/scripts/migrate_bim_to_s3.py` walks `data/bim/` and uploads every existing file to the configured S3 bucket via the new abstraction. One-time runner for deployments switching from local to cloud storage',
      'New optional dependency — `aioboto3>=12.0.0` added under `[project.optional-dependencies] s3` in `backend/pyproject.toml`. `pip install openconstructionerp` continues to work without it; users only install `[s3]` extras when they actually want cloud storage. Importing S3StorageBackend without aioboto3 raises a clear ImportError instead of crashing at startup',
      'BIM viewer filter panel re-tested end-to-end after the SaveGroup wiring: storey filter (5440→317), buildings-only toggle (5440↔5168), Walls type filter (→205), clear all (→5168), multi-chip OR (Doors=108, Doors+Walls=313), all 5 camera presets, grid toggle, element click → AddToBOQ modal with real BOQ positions, Save as group → SaveGroupModal renders. 60 fps stable on the 5 440-mesh demo model',

      'BIM viewer is verified end-to-end via headless deep test (debug-bim.cjs): all camera presets (Top/Front/Side/Iso/Fit) move the camera to the correct position, grid toggle flips visibility, element click opens the properties panel with "Linked BOQ positions" section, "Add to BOQ" button opens the modal with both tabs populated by real BOQ positions from the demo project, /bim/rules page renders the empty state, and the storey + buildings-only + Walls type filter + clear all + multi-chip OR all pass with 60 fps on real GPU',
      'BIM viewer headless test (frontend/debug-bim.cjs) was extended with 4 new test groups: camera preset verification (TEST 6), grid toggle (TEST 7), element click → AddToBOQ modal (TEST 7b), navigation to /bim/rules (TEST 8), and a synthetic stress test that clones the demo scene 4× to ~21 760 meshes (TEST 9). The stress test confirms the per-mesh path holds 60 fps up to ~5 000 meshes and degrades to ~2 fps at 21 000 — informing the BatchedMesh follow-up below',
      'Fix: sidebar now shows "BIM Rules" instead of the raw `nav.bim_rules` translation key — added the missing English fallback in i18n-fallbacks.ts',
      'Internal: ElementManager now contains a `batchMeshesByMaterial()` method that uses Three.js BatchedMesh to collapse same-material meshes into one draw call per material (groups with ≥10 instances).  Currently gated behind a 50 000-mesh threshold so it never triggers on real-world models — Three.js BatchedMesh.setVisibleAt has subtle GPU-sync issues that cause partial renders when filters change rapidly, so the per-mesh path is the default for everything below 50 k meshes (which is comfortably 60 fps).  The proper fix is to pre-bake batched meshes on the BACKEND side as part of the canonical-format conversion, which is the storage architecture work in progress',

      'BIM ↔ BOQ linking — the headline feature. The backend link infrastructure was fully built but had zero UI until now. Closing the gap end-to-end: (1) BIMElementResponse now embeds a boq_links array of BOQElementLinkBrief objects so the viewer knows per-element link state on first fetch, (2) the element details panel in the viewer renders a "Linked BOQ positions" section on every selected element with ordinal/description/link-type badge and an unlink button per link, (3) a new "Add to BOQ" modal (features/bim/AddToBOQModal.tsx, ~550 lines) offers two tabs — "Link to existing position" (searchable list of BOQ positions for the project) and "Create new position" (pre-filled form with aggregated quantities, unit, description, classification from the element) — both single-element and bulk-element paths in one shot',
      'Quick takeoff: a new "Link N visible elements to BOQ" button in the filter panel runs AddToBOQ on the current filtered subset, so clicking Walls + 01 Entry Level + Quick Takeoff creates one BOQ position linked to all 211 walls on the ground floor in three clicks',
      'BIM Quantity Rules page at /bim/rules — dedicated UI for rule-based bulk linking (the professional Vico/iTWO/Solibri approach). Define patterns like "IFC WALL + material=Concrete + thickness≥0.24 → DIN 276 330", preview matches via dry-run, then apply to create BOQElementLink rows + auto-created BOQ positions in bulk. Integrates with the existing BIMQuantityMap backend model and the /quantity-maps/ endpoints',
      'apply_quantity_maps now actually persists — previously it returned a preview and never wrote anything. It now honours the dry_run flag (default True for safety), wraps each rule in a savepoint, skips duplicate (position, element) pairs, supports auto-creating BOQ positions when the rule has auto_create:true, and returns new links_created + positions_created counters',
      'Position.cad_element_ids is auto-synced on link CRUD — every create_link / delete_link now updates the JSON array on the corresponding BOQ position so the existing "is linked" checks everywhere in the codebase stay consistent. Added a sync_cad_element_ids(project_id) back-fill service method for legacy rows',
      'Bi-directional selection sync — new useBIMLinkSelectionStore (Zustand) publishes "BOQ row selected → highlight linked BIM elements in orange" and "BIM element selected → scroll BOQ row into view". Cross-highlighting works even when both pages are open in split-view',
      'Linked-count badge — a green "N linked" chip in the viewer top-right shows at-a-glance how many elements already have BOQ links, so the user can see takeoff progress without opening the BOQ editor',
      'Viewer toolbar rework — removed the broken 4D/5D view-mode stubs (visual-only, never wired to cost or schedule data), added a camera preset group (Fit / Isometric / Top / Front / Side) via SceneManager.setCameraPreset, wired the existing toggleGrid() to a Grid button, and consolidated every button into a single bordered row with function-group dividers (Camera | Selection | Visibility). Professional toolbar taxonomy per the Vico / Forge / BIMcollab research brief',
      'New BIMElement.highlight(elementIds) method on ElementManager — colours matching meshes orange WITHOUT hiding the rest, so the user sees the spatial distribution of whichever BOQ position they clicked. Driven by the new highlightedIds prop on BIMViewer',
      'Per-project link count visible in the BOQ grid — positions with cad_element_ids.length > 0 now render a small blue pill showing the link count in their row, so estimators see takeoff coverage at a glance while scrolling through the BOQ',

      'BIM viewer Storeys filter is now actually usable. The DDC RVT export ships ~10 000 annotation/analytical rows with `storey: null` which dominated the storey list and showed up as a useless "—" entry. The Storeys section now (1) is scoped by the "Building elements only" toggle so the noise rows are excluded entirely, (2) parses the leading level number from each name ("01 - Entry Level" → level 1, label "Entry Level"), (3) renders a small numeric badge in front of each chip ("01", "02", "03", "G" for ground, "B1" for basement), (4) sorts ground-up by parsed level number instead of alphabetical, (5) adds an "All levels" link when any storey is selected. Verified end-to-end via headless Playwright: clicking the Entry Level chip drops viewport visibility from 5 168 → 317 meshes and zooms to that floor only',
      'BIM filter panel verified by deep test: Walls chip = 205 visible meshes, Doors chip = 108, Walls + Doors together = 313 (perfect OR-set semantics across selected types). Buildings-only toggle proven to hide 272 noise meshes on the demo. Real-GPU FPS measured at 60 on the 5 440-mesh model after the v1.3.20 perf pass',

      'BIM viewer is much faster on real-world models — measured live in headless Playwright. Three causes: (1) DDC RvtExporter ships ~40 spotlights inside its DAE which ColladaLoader silently added to the scene, turning a 4-light setup into a 46-light shadow disaster; (2) every COLLADA mesh inherited castShadow=true so the renderer rebuilt a shadow map for 5 000+ casters per frame; (3) the directional light itself was a shadow caster with a 2048×2048 map. Fix: strip every Light/Camera at COLLADA-load time, force castShadow=false on every BIM mesh, disable shadow casting on the directional light, and turn off the renderer-level shadowMap. The 5 440-mesh demo went from 1 fps → 30+ fps in headless software-render',
      'BIM viewer grid is now sized to the loaded model (1 m cells, extent ≈ 1.6 × the model footprint) instead of the fixed 100 × 100 m default — small Revit exports were sitting inside an enormous grid that dwarfed the geometry',
      'BIM viewer now caps renderer pixel ratio at 1 (was capped at 2) — high-DPI rendering on a 5 000-mesh scene quadruples fragment cost for marginal visual gain',
      'BIM viewer locks matrixAutoUpdate=false on every COLLADA mesh after the initial transform — Three.js no longer recomputes 5 000+ world matrices every frame',
      'BIM viewer camera fits the model tighter (multiplier 1.4 → 1.05) so the geometry actually fills the viewport instead of sitting in the middle with ~40 % empty margin',
      'BIM filter panel reorganised into semantic buckets (Structure / Envelope / Doors & Windows / MEP / Furniture / Annotations / Analytical) — DDC RVT exports were dumping 50+ raw Revit categories like "Analytical Nodes", "Weak Dims" and "Area Scheme Lines" as flat chips, drowning the categories that estimators actually care about',
      'BIM filter panel adds a "Building elements only" toggle (default ON) that hides annotation/analytical noise from the viewport — verified hides ~1 500 noise meshes on the demo model',
      'BIM filter panel: clicking a category chip now zooms the camera to the visible subset, giving immediate spatial feedback — applies on every filter/isolate change and zooms back out when the filter is cleared',
      'BIM viewer now uses a positional fallback to wire DAE meshes to elements when the converter (looking at you, DDC RvtExporter) drops node names. Approximate but lets filters actually do something on the viewport instead of being a no-op',

      'Fix: BIM viewer camera now correctly frames the model on first load — diagnosed via headless Playwright (model was 1 m wide but camera was 1840 m away, off by 1000×). Three root causes: (1) placeholder boxes from element bounding_box created an early bbox in source-CAD units that the first zoomToFit framed; (2) SceneManager.zoomToFit did not force updateMatrixWorld so it read stale identity matrices on the first call; (3) BIMViewer only fired one post-DAE zoomToFit which often beat ColladaLoader\'s microtask flush. Fix: skip placeholders when a real DAE URL is queued, force updateMatrixWorld at the top of zoomToFit, and schedule the post-DAE fit at 0/50/250 ms',

      'Fix: backend no longer silently exits on Windows + Anaconda Python during startup — root cause was an MKL/OpenMP DLL conflict (libiomp5md.dll loaded twice from both Anaconda and torch), which triggered a native TerminateProcess call with no Python traceback. Fixed by setting KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE + OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 + MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 as the very first thing in app/main.py, before any import that can pull in numpy or torch',
      'Fix: vector DB status check no longer eagerly loads the sentence-transformers model (which pulled in torch and ~400 MB of weights just to return a boolean can_generate_locally). Now uses importlib.util.find_spec() as a lazy availability check — startup is ~30 seconds faster and avoids the torch import path entirely when the embedder is not actually needed',
      'Fix: vector DB status check no longer eagerly opens a Qdrant connection during startup just to populate can_restore_snapshots. Same lazy-check approach — if qdrant-client is installed, we assume snapshot restore is possible',
      'Feature: _init_vector_db() now logs actionable hints when vector backend is not reachable — e.g. "Start a local Qdrant with: docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant" or "Install the embedded vector backend with: pip install openconstructionerp[vector]"',
      'Feature: Qdrant is still the recommended production vector backend (supports snapshots, scales to millions of vectors). The app simply degrades gracefully to LanceDB or disables semantic search if Qdrant is unreachable, instead of crashing',
      'Fix: https://openconstructionerp.com/demo/ now correctly serves the SPA index.html instead of returning {"detail":"Not Found"}. Root cause was a Starlette lifecycle trap — mount_frontend() registered its SPA 404 exception handler INSIDE the startup event handler, but by then Starlette had already built the ExceptionMiddleware with a snapshot of app.exception_handlers, so the new handler never became active. Moved mount_frontend() into create_app() (before the app is returned), so the handler is in place before the first lifespan message is processed',
