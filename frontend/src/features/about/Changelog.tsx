      'Cross-module semantic memory layer — every business module now participates in a unified vector store via the new `EmbeddingAdapter` protocol. Six new collections live alongside the existing CWICR cost index: oe_boq_positions, oe_documents, oe_tasks, oe_risks, oe_bim_elements, oe_validation, oe_chat. All collections share one schema so the unified search layer writes to any of them through one code path',
      'Multilingual embedding model — switched the default from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (English-only) to intfloat/multilingual-e5-small (50+ languages, same 384-dim). CWICR\'s 9-language cost database now ranks correctly across English, German, Russian, Lithuanian, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Portuguese. The legacy model is kept as a graceful fallback so existing LanceDB tables stay loadable',
      'Event-driven indexing — every Position / Document / Task / Risk / BIM Element create/update/delete event triggers an automatic upsert into the matching vector collection. No cron jobs, no Celery workers, no manual reindex needed for normal operation. Failures are logged and swallowed so vector indexing can never break a CRUD path',
      'Per-module reindex / status / similar endpoints — every participating module now exposes GET /vector/status/, POST /vector/reindex/?project_id=...&purge_first=false, and GET /{id}/similar/?limit=5&cross_project=true. Live for BOQ, Documents, Tasks, Risks and BIM elements',
      'Unified cross-collection search API — new oe_search module with GET /api/v1/search/?q=...&types=boq,documents,risks fans out to every selected collection in parallel and merges via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Plus /search/status/ and /search/types/',
      'Cmd+Shift+K Global Search modal — frontend GlobalSearchModal with debounced input, facet pills (BOQ / Documents / Tasks / Risks / BIM / Validation / Chat) showing per-collection hit counts, current project scope toggle, grouped results and click-to-navigate routing. Works from any page including text fields',
      'Universal "Similar items" panel — drop-in <SimilarItemsPanel module="risks" id={...} /> component for any record card. Embedded in Risk Register detail (cross-project lessons learned reuse), BIM viewer element details, and Documents preview modal',
      'AI Chat semantic tools — six new tool definitions: search_boq_positions, search_documents, search_tasks, search_risks, search_bim_elements, search_anything. Each tool returns ranked hits with confidence scores. System prompt updated to prefer semantic tools for free-text questions and to quote provenance in responses',
      'AI Advisor RAG injection — project_intelligence/advisor.py answer_question() now retrieves the top-12 semantic hits from the unified search layer and injects them into the LLM prompt as a "Relevant context (semantic retrieval)" block. The advisor is now a proper RAG agent — answers stay anchored in real evidence instead of hallucinating',
      'Verification: 759 total routes mounted, 28 vector / similar / search routes wired end-to-end, 217 487 CWICR cost vectors auto-loaded on startup, frontend tsc --noEmit clean, backend imports clean across foundation + 5 modules + unified search + 6 new chat tools + advisor RAG',

      'BIM viewer now shows a top-of-viewport health stats banner with multi-pill clickable chips: total elements, BOQ-linked count, validation errors, warnings, has-tasks and has-documents.  Each pill is a one-click smart filter that narrows the viewport to the matching element bucket — instant triage of model health without opening the filter sidebar',
      'BIMFilterPanel exposes the same five smart-filter chips at the top of the sidebar (errors / warnings / unlinked-to-BOQ / has tasks / has documents) with live counts derived from the cross-module link arrays on each element.  Chips only render when the bucket has matches so the panel stays clean on a healthy model',
      'Three new color-by modes for the BIM viewer grouped under "By compliance": 🛡️ Validation status (red error / amber warning / green pass / grey unchecked), 💰 BOQ link coverage (red unlinked / green linked), 📄 Document coverage.  Implemented via a new `ElementManager.colorByDirect()` helper that paints meshes from a fixed palette without rebuilding materials — keeps 60 fps even on 16k+ element models',
      'New `POST /api/v1/costs/suggest-for-element/` endpoint ranks CWICR cost items for a BIM element by classification overlap (DIN 276 / OmniClass), element-type / material / family keyword matches in description and code, and discipline tag overlap.  Each result returns a 0..1 confidence score plus human-readable match_reasons.  DB-agnostic (works on PostgreSQL AND SQLite), no pgvector required, candidate window capped at 200 with Python-side ranking',
      'AddToBOQModal "Create new position" tab now fetches the top-5 ranked rates for the clicked element on open and renders them as one-click chips with code, description, unit rate, unit, confidence dot (green ≥60% / amber ≥35% / grey otherwise) and a hover tooltip listing match reasons.  Clicking a chip populates description / unit / unit_rate from the matching CWICR item — no manual lookup needed.  Quantity is preserved (it comes from BIM geometry, not the cost database)',
      'Verification: tsc --noEmit clean, backend imports clean, both new endpoints and 13 existing routes mounted, smart filter chips + banner + colour modes wire end-to-end through BIMPage → BIMViewer → BIMFilterPanel without prop drilling spaghetti',

No more navigating to /tasks → fill form → come back → reload to see the link.  Each section in the element details panel now has a "+ New" or "+ Link" button right next to its count badge',
      'New CreateTaskFromBIMModal — clicks "+ New" in the Linked Tasks section.  Pre-fills the title with element type ("Issue on Walls"), pins bim_element_ids on create so the new task instantly appears in the panel via React Query invalidation.  Type / priority / due date selectors built in.  Multi-element bulk-pin supported — when called with N elements the new task lands on all of them in one shot',
      'New LinkDocumentToBIMModal — clicks "+ Link" in the Linked Documents section.  Lists every document in the active project with searchable name / category / drawing-number / discipline filter.  Click a row → POST to /documents/bim-links/ → invalidates the bim-elements query → link badge appears in the panel without page reload',
      'New LinkActivityToBIMModal — clicks "+ Link" in the Schedule Activities section.  Loads every activity from every schedule in the project (parallel fetch, capped at 200 visible).  Click a row → PATCH /schedule/activities/{id}/bim-links additively (existing pinned elements are preserved, new ones appended) → invalidates the bim-elements query',
      'Cross-module sections always render — the four section blocks (BOQ / Documents / Tasks / Activities) used to be conditionally rendered only when the element had at least one link.  Now they always render with empty-state placeholders + the "+ Add" buttons so first-time users can discover the linking workflow without needing a pre-existing link to find the section',
      'Validation ↔ BIM per-element rules engine — new POST /api/v1/validation/check-bim-model endpoint runs universal BIM rules (wall has thickness, structural has material, fire-rating present, MEP has system, etc.) against every element in a model.  Live test on the demo: 33 962 rule checks → 22 610 passed / 10 497 warnings / 1 163 errors in one shot.  Per-element results are eager-loaded into BIMElementResponse.validation_results + the worst severity is rolled up into BIMElementResponse.validation_status (pass / warning / error / unchecked)',
      'BIM viewer renders per-element validation badge — new "Validation results" section appears in the element details panel when the element has at least one validation result, colour-coded by worst severity (rose for error, amber for warning, emerald for pass) with a ShieldX / ShieldAlert / ShieldCheck icon.  Lists up to 6 failed rules with rule_id + message preview',
      'Tasks page TaskCard renders a "Pinned to N BIM element(s)" badge in the source-indicator slot when the task has bim_element_ids populated.  Click the badge → /bim?element=… opens the BIM viewer with the first pinned element preselected.  Reverse-direction navigation symmetric with the existing Documents preview footer',
      'Bug fix — ValidationReportResponse pydantic schema was reading `report.metadata` from the SQLAlchemy ORM, which collides with the SQLAlchemy class-level `MetaData()` registry.  Switched to `validation_alias=AliasChoices("metadata_", "metadata")` so Pydantic reads the python attribute name first.  All validation routes (existing and the new check-bim-model) now serialise correctly',
      'Verification: 16 backend files compile clean, 5 new frontend files added (3 inline modals + extended types), tsc --noEmit clean, headless deep test 10/10 PASS at 60 fps, end-to-end curl tests pass for: validation run (33 962 checks), per-element validation embed, document link create + delete',

Each section is collapsible, shows count badges, and clicking any row navigates to the matching detail page in the other module',
      'New `oe_documents_bim_link` table — joins Documents to BIM Elements with link_type (manual/auto), confidence, and a future-proof region_bbox column for PDF region markup.  Endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE under /api/v1/documents/bim-links/.  Bidirectional querying: filter by element_id OR document_id.  Eager-loaded into BIMElementResponse.linked_documents with document_name + document_category briefs in one round-trip',
      'New `Task.bim_element_ids` JSON column on `oe_tasks_task` — spatial defect management.  PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id}/bim-links replaces the array, GET /api/v1/tasks/?bim_element_id=… is the reverse query.  Eager-loaded into BIMElementResponse.linked_tasks with title + status + task_type + due_date',
      'Schedule activity ↔ BIM linking — `Activity.bim_element_ids` field has existed since v1.x but was never wired up.  v1.3.30 adds: PATCH /api/v1/schedule/activities/{id}/bim-links, GET /api/v1/schedule/activities/by-bim-element/?element_id=…&project_id=…, and embedded brief in BIMElementResponse.linked_activities with name + start/end dates + percent_complete.  No migration needed (column was already there)',
      'Documents page preview modal — when previewing a drawing, a new "Linked BIM elements" footer strip lists every BIM element this document is linked to.  Click any element chip → navigates to /bim?element=… with the element preselected (reverse-direction navigation)',

Type definitions for `BIMDocumentLinkBrief` / `BIMTaskBrief` / `BIMActivityBrief` added to ElementManager.ts',

      'Chat page (/chat) — removed the redundant "ERP AI Assistant" top bar.  The app\'s main layout already provides a header; the chat-specific bar duplicated UI and didn\'t match the rest of the site palette.  Clear chat now lives in the input bar (left panel)',
      'Release pipeline — synced root `CHANGELOG.md` with the in-app `Changelog.tsx` from v1.3.22 onwards.  The release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` reads `## [VERSION]` patterns from CHANGELOG.md when a `v*` tag is pushed; without a matching section the GitHub release ships with a generic fallback message.  Now every v1.3.x release has a proper section in CHANGELOG.md with Added/Changed/Fixed bullets',
      'Update notification badge — investigation: the `UpdateNotification` widget polls https://api.github.com/repos/datadrivenconstruction/OpenConstructionERP/releases/latest every hour and shows a sidebar card when the latest GitHub release is newer than the running app version.  The widget is working — the gap was that GitHub\'s latest release was still v0.8.0 because **no version tags had been pushed since v1.0.0**.  All v1.3.x bumps lived in local commits only.  To restore the badge for old installations: tag the current commit (`git tag v1.3.29 && git push origin v1.3.29`), the release workflow auto-builds Docker + creates the GitHub release, and within an hour every running v1.3.x install pings the GitHub API and lights up the update card',

      'BIM filter — universal "Building elements" + "Annotations & analytical" split.  User report: the wrong elements showed up under each category, the grouping was unclear, and different projects need different rules.  Replaced the manually-curated noise list with a universal split driven by `bucketOf()` — every category lands in either a real building bucket (Structure / Envelope / Openings / MEP / Furniture / …) OR a noise bucket (Annotations / Analytical).  The Category panel now renders building chips at the top in normal style and a collapsible "Annotations & analytical" section underneath that\'s closed by default but always present.  Works zero-curation for any project',
      'BIM filter — pretty category names.  Real DDC RvtExporter output stores normalised lowercase concatenated category names like "Curtainwallmullions" / "Structuralcolumns" / "Doortags".  New `prettifyCategoryName()` looks each one up in a curated table of ~150 well-known Revit categories and renders the natural English form ("Curtain Wall Mullions" / "Structural Columns" / "Door Tags").  Anything not in the table gets first-letter capitalised but is otherwise un-touched — never algorithmically guessing word boundaries (the wrong split "Stair Srailingbaluster" is worse than the ugly-but-correct "Stairsrailingbaluster")',
      'BIM filter — "None" element_type (the 6 048 Revit-ingest junk rows in the demo) now classified as noise so the buildings-only view doesn\'t pollute the panel with thousands of uncategorised rows.  Real building-element baseline drops from "everything" to "everything except None + annotations + analytical" automatically',
      'Headless test verdict logic — clear-all assertion now compares against the buildings-only baseline instead of the raw mesh count, since buildings-only is sticky and doesn\'t reset.  All 10 verdicts now PASS deterministically: storey filter, clear storey, buildings-only toggle, Walls type filter (5440 → 205), clear all (back to 2294 baseline), multi-chip OR (Doors=108, +Walls=313), group save → list, group apply (2294 → 205), group delete, 60 fps stable',

      'BIM filter panel — three professional grouping modes via a new segmented control: **By Category** (flat list of every Revit category / IFC entity, default — works for both formats with zero curation), **By Type Name** (hierarchical Category → Family/Type Name like the Revit Browser, with chevron-collapsible category headers), and **Buckets** (existing semantic Structure / Envelope / MEP / … grouping kept as a third option).  Fixes the user complaint that the bucket-only view felt incomplete and unclear about how filters were structured',
      'New `getTypeNameKey()` helper resolves the second-level Type Name from `el.name` first, then `properties.family`, `properties["family and type"]`, or `properties.type`.  Real Revit data has 100% `name` coverage and 75% `properties.family` coverage, so the type-name view always populates',
      'Added explicit "Clear types" link in the type-filter section header (matches the existing "All levels" link in the storey section) so users have a one-click way to drop type selections without re-clicking each chip',
      'Headless test extended (TEST 7d) — verifies all three grouping modes by clicking the segmented control buttons and counting category headers: 127 category headers rendered in Type Name mode on the demo (every distinct element_type gets its own collapsible header).  Screenshots saved at 14-typename-grouping.png and 15-buckets-grouping.png',
      'Headless test fix — TEST 7b\'s modal-close button selector was matching the close button on the BIM filter panel itself (both are X-icon lucide buttons), accidentally closing the panel between tests and breaking TEST 7c.  Scoped the close-button query to elements inside the `.fixed.inset-0.z-50` modal overlay only.  All 10 verdicts now PASS deterministically',

      'Fix: "Add to BOQ" link create returned 500 Internal Server Error on every click. Root cause: the v1.3.22 backend agent\'s ownership check `_verify_boq_position_access()` referenced `position.project_id` directly, but `Position` has no `project_id` column — the project lives on the parent `BOQ` row reached via `position.boq_id`. Fix: rewrote the helper as a single-row SELECT that joins Position → BOQ and pulls `BOQ.project_id` in one round-trip. Verified end-to-end via curl (link created, cad_element_ids synced, boq_links embedded in element response, delete works) and via the headless deep test',
      'Fix: headless test for Save-as-group lifecycle was flaky — the assertion ran 2 s after the POST, but the React Query refetch + panel re-render chain sometimes took longer. Replaced the fixed timeout with a 6-s polling loop that breaks as soon as the saved-groups section appears, eliminating false-negative FAILs',

Each row shows the group\'s color dot, name, and cached member count.  Clicking a group converts its `filter_criteria` back into the panel\'s Set-based filter state and highlights the row as the active group.  Manual filter changes drop the highlight automatically because the filter is no longer 1:1 with the group',
      'BIM saved groups — fetched via `useQuery(["bim-element-groups", projectId, modelId])` from the new `/api/v1/bim_hub/element-groups/` endpoint, with React Query auto-refetch on save / delete via `invalidateQueries`.  Delete uses a confirmation dialog and the new `deleteElementGroup` API wrapper.  Link-to-BOQ resolves the group\'s `member_element_ids` against the loaded element list and opens AddToBOQModal with the resolved subset',
      'Headless deep test (debug-bim.cjs TEST 7c) now exercises the FULL lifecycle: filter Walls → click "Save as group" → type a unique group name → click "Save group" → verify the new SAVED GROUPS section lists it → click Clear all → click the saved group row → verify mesh visibility re-narrows to the original 205 walls → click the trash icon → confirm bypassed → verify the group disappears.  All five sub-assertions PASS — group save → list, group apply, group delete',
      'Test verdict logic — clear-storey now compares against the buildings-only baseline (5168) instead of the raw mesh count (5440), so the previous WARN flips to PASS.  The buildings-only toggle hides 272 noise meshes by default, which is the expected baseline for every filter test',

(2) New `oe_bim_element_group` table for saved selections — dynamic groups recompute members from a filter predicate, static groups freeze the snapshot. (3) Full design captured in `docs/BIM-STORAGE-ARCHITECTURE.md` covering the three layers, the cross-module link unification roadmap, and the migration path for existing deployments',

The Storeys section now (1) is scoped by the "Building elements only" toggle so the noise rows are excluded entirely, (2) parses the leading level number from each name ("01 - Entry Level" → level 1, label "Entry Level"), (3) renders a small numeric badge in front of each chip ("01", "02", "03", "G" for ground, "B1" for basement), (4) sorts ground-up by parsed level number instead of alphabetical, (5) adds an "All levels" link when any storey is selected.

Three causes: (1) DDC RvtExporter ships ~40 spotlights inside its DAE which ColladaLoader silently added to the scene, turning a 4-light setup into a 46-light shadow disaster; (2) every COLLADA mesh inherited castShadow=true so the renderer rebuilt a shadow map for 5 000+ casters per frame; (3) the directional light itself was a shadow caster with a 2048×2048 map. Fix: strip every Light/Camera at COLLADA-load time, force castShadow=false on every BIM mesh, disable shadow casting on the directional light, and turn off the renderer-level shadowMap.
