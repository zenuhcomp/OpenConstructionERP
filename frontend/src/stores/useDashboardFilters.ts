/**
 * useDashboardFilters — Power BI-style cross-filter state for the BI dashboards page.
 *
 * Wave 4 / T11. A click on a tile/cell that defines a ``drill_path`` shoves
 * a ``{filter_field: filter_value}`` pair into this store, which the page
 * then forwards to ``POST /v1/bi-dashboards/{id}/evaluate`` so every widget
 * is re-evaluated against the new filter.
 *
 * Scoped per ``activeDashboardId`` so navigating to a different dashboard
 * starts with a clean filter slate — chips don't leak across boards.
 * Not persisted: filter state is intentionally session-only; refresh wipes
 * the chips and starts from the dashboard's static aggregate.
