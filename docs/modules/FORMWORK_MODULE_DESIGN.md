## 1. Executive Summary

Formwork (Schalung / coffrage / encofrado / опалубка) is the **single most expensive
re-usable line item** on most concrete-heavy projects, yet it is the line item
**most poorly tracked** by general-purpose ERP and PMIS tools. A 240 m² wall-panel set
from a major supplier rents at roughly EUR 4–7 per m² per day; one mid-rise residential
project routinely runs EUR 200k–800k in formwork rental over a 9-month shell phase,
with a further 5–15 % surcharge silently absorbed at end-of-job for damage, missing
ties, and idle days that nobody attributed to a pour. Existing GC software treats
formwork either as bulk equipment (loses the panel-level accountability) or as a
material line on the BOQ (loses the rental clock and the condition history).

This module gives OpenConstructionERP a **first-class formwork lifecycle** —
catalogue, unit, accessory, order, assignment-to-pour, inspection, movement —
that fits a small contractor running 50 panels on one floor *and* a Doka-class
rental yard issuing 10 000 panels across 30 projects. It is vendor-neutral by
design: Doka, Peri, Ulma, Meva, Hünnebeck, RMD Kwikform, Faresin, Efco, and any
in-house steel/timber system register as `FormworkSystem` rows; no manufacturer
is privileged. Mobile-first field UX (PWA, scan + tap, offline queue) is a
core requirement, not an afterthought — the foreman, not the office, is the
primary writer of state changes.

---

## 2. Domain Primer (for non-construction readers)

**Formwork** is the temporary mould into which fresh concrete is poured. Once
the concrete has cured (typically 12 h to 7 days depending on element and mix),
the formwork is stripped, cleaned, and re-used on the next pour. A typical
concrete-shell project will cycle the same panels 20–80 times over its life.

Major **categories** the module must represent natively:

| Category               | Example use                                | Daily-rate driver       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Wall (Wand)            | Basement walls, shaft walls, retaining     | m² of formed surface    |
| Slab (Decke)           | Suspended floors, transfer slabs           | m² of formed surface    |
| Column (Stütze)        | Rectangular / round columns                | Lin. m of column height |
| Climbing (Klettern)    | Cores / shafts cast lift-by-lift           | Per climbing unit       |
| Self-climbing / ACS    | Tall cores cast without a crane lift       | Per ACS bracket         |
| Table (Tisch)          | Large pre-assembled slab decks, flown      | Per table assembly      |
| Modular framed         | Standard panel grid (Framax, Maximo, etc.) | m² of panel face        |
| Beam / heavy duty      | Transfer beams, post-tensioned beams       | Lin. m of beam soffit   |
| Shoring / falsework    | Vertical load support under slabs          | Per prop / per tower    |
| Single-face / blindside | Slurry walls, against existing structure  | m² of formed face       |

**Accessories** are the small parts that make formwork work: ties (DW15 /
DW20 / SK series), wing nuts, water-stop ties, cones, anchors, climbing
brackets, push-pull props, tripods, walers, soldiers, corner units, infill
timbers, magnets, chamfer strips, form release oil. Some accessories are
**re-usable** (ties, props), some are **consumed per pour** (cones, sleeves,
release oil). The module must distinguish: re-usable accessories track like
panels; consumables track as inventory drawdown against the project's BOQ.

A formwork **pour cycle** is the smallest unit of useful work the module
models: *deliver → set → align → close → pour → cure → strip → clean → move
or return*. Rental clocks run from delivery to return, not from set to
strip — so leaving panels idle on a slab for 11 days because the rebar crew
was late is a real and frequently un-attributed cost.

**Engineering input** typically comes from the formwork supplier's own CAD
tool (Doka Tipos 8, Peri CAD, Ulma 3D-Form). Output is a per-pour drawing
plus a list of panels and accessories. OpenConstructionERP will not embed
those tools; it ingests their output as a CSV/Excel/JSON parts list and
optionally the IFC of the formwork assembly through the existing DDC
cad2data pipeline.

## 3. Entity Model

All models live in `backend/app/modules/formwork/models.py` and follow
existing OCERP conventions (UUID PK via `GUID()`, `oe_formwork_*` table
prefix, `metadata_` JSON column for extension, server defaults on money
and currency, `created_at` / `updated_at` from `Base`).

### 3.1 Catalogue layer (tenant-shared, seedable)

```

Twelve tables total. Numeric money: `Numeric(18, 4)` with `server_default="0"`,
currency `String(3)` with `server_default=""` (service layer fills from tenant
preference — see `feedback_no_orjson_default` and the v3 EUR-default audit).
All money fields are serialised as strings in API responses to avoid the
float-money trap currently flagged across modules in `MONEY_FLOAT_REMAINING.md`.

## 4. API Surface

All endpoints mount at `/api/v1/formwork/`. Responses use the existing
`{data: ..., meta: ...}` envelope where the module already returns lists.

## 5. Frontend Pages

Frontend lives at `frontend/src/features/formwork/`. Routes registered through
the existing `app/router` module config. All strings via `useTranslation('formwork')`.

```

Key behaviours:
- AG Grid (same shared component as BOQ); column visibility persisted per user.
- Row click opens drawer with movements + assignment history (no full nav).
- Filters preserved in URL (deep-linkable).
- Bulk selection enables status change, move, scrap, print-labels.
- Reskin warning surfaces inline (asterisk + tooltip) before the unit goes
  out — yard managers told us this is their #1 ask.

### 5.3 Planning calendar (desktop) — ASCII wireframe

| Idle alerts: 12 panels on Level 2 stripped 5 d ago, not moved (cost: EUR 410) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bars are draggable; dragging recomputes daily-rate impact in the right rail
sidebar and warns when re-use chains break (e.g. shifting Level 4 set earlier
than Level 3 strip).

```

Implementation notes:
- PWA already configured at app root; this view registers a dedicated service
  worker route for `/formwork/field/*` that caches the last `/field/sync`
  payload in IndexedDB.
- Quick-action POSTs are wrapped in the existing `sync_queue` hook (used by
  `daily_diary` and `fieldreports`). Each action gets a client UUID so a
  replay after offline window is idempotent server-side.
- Camera scanning via `@zxing/browser` (already a dep in `bim_hub` for QR
  scanning the markup tokens). Manual entry fallback always visible.
- One-handed thumb zone: primary actions in the bottom 40 % of the screen.

## 6. Integration Points

| Module                     | Direction | Event / call                                       | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `oe_projects`              | depends   | FK + project lifecycle subscription                | Assignments require a project; project archive cascades to assignments. |
| `oe_users`                 | depends   | Role/user lookup                                   | Foreman / yard manager / project manager identity.   |
| `oe_contacts`              | consumes  | Contact lookup (supplier)                          | Order supplier and chargeback target.                |
| `oe_documents`             | consumes  | Document IDs for photos                            | Inspection and damage report attachments.            |
| `oe_costs`                 | consumes  | Daily rate lookup; rolls up to project EAC         | Cost-of-formwork shows on EAC and project P&L.       |
| `oe_procurement`           | bidirectional | Emits `formwork.order.confirmed` -> procurement event handler creates PO; consumes `procurement.po.cancelled` to mark FormworkOrder cancelled. | Auto-PO from rental order; reverse cancellation propagates. |
| `oe_bim_hub` / `oe_cad`    | consumes  | Canonical-format zone / element IDs                | Assignments may reference a BIM zone (level + section) without coupling to IFC parser. NO IfcOpenShell. |
| `oe_clash`                 | emits     | `formwork.assignment.set` carries level + zone     | Clash module flags formwork that geometrically conflicts with rebar / MEP. |
| `oe_schedule_advanced`     | emits     | `formwork.assignment.transition`                   | Schedule tasks tagged "concrete pour L3 core A" can auto-link assignments and surface idle-days on the Gantt. |
| `oe_hse_advanced`          | emits/consumes | Failed inspection emits HSE-relevant incident if severity >= major; HSE inspection covering "shoring / falsework" can short-circuit to formwork inspection list. | Falsework collapse is the single highest-severity event on a concrete project — HSE must see it. |
| `oe_daily_diary`           | emits     | `formwork.assignment.transition` auto-creates diary entry stub | The diary entry the PM has to write every evening becomes one click instead of remembering 8 events. |
| `oe_eac` / `oe_full_evm`   | consumes  | Daily accrual stream                               | Earned-value tracking includes formwork burn vs forecast. |
| `oe_carbon`                | consumes  | Re-use cycle count -> embodied carbon amortisation | A panel re-used 60× has dramatically lower embodied carbon per pour than a panel re-used 4×. |
| `oe_dashboard`             | consumes  | New widget kind: `formwork.utilisation`            | Joins the existing dashboard widget catalogue.       |
| `oe_validation` (core)     | consumes  | Validation rules: `formwork.assignment_open_for_too_long`, `formwork.unit_in_two_open_assignments`, `formwork.return_pending_after_project_close`. | First-class citizen of OCERP's validation framework. |

Event names follow the `module.entity.verb` convention already in use by
`tendering.package.awarded`, `procurement.po.cancelled`, and the schedule FSM.

## 7. RBAC + Permissions Matrix

Permissions registered in `permissions.py` and consumed by `RequirePermission`
in the router. The site-worker role is a new addition to the existing role
hierarchy — implemented as a **role alias** in `ROLE_ALIASES` so the four
canonical roles (`admin`, `manager`, `editor`, `viewer`) stay intact, and
`site_worker` resolves to `editor` with **project-scoped record filters**
applied in the repository layer (same pattern used by `subcontractors`).

```python
permission_registry.register_module_permissions("formwork", {
    "formwork.system.read":              Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.system.manage":            Role.ADMIN,
    "formwork.unit.read":                Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.unit.create":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.update":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.scrap":               Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.bulk_status":         Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.accessory.read":           Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.accessory.manage":         Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.accessory.reconcile":      Role.MANAGER,    # yard_manager alias -> MANAGER
    "formwork.order.read":               Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.order.create":             Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.confirm":            Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.promote_to_po":      Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.close":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.assignment.read":          Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.assignment.create":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.update":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.transition":    Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.reuse":         Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.inspection.create":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.inspection.approve":       Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.movement.read":            Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.movement.create":          Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.field.scan":               Role.VIEWER,     # site_worker alias -> EDITOR
    "formwork.field.quick_action":       Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.dashboard.project":        Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.dashboard.yard":           Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.report.export":            Role.VIEWER,
})

# In ROLE_ALIASES (core/permissions.py)
ROLE_ALIASES["site_worker"] = Role.EDITOR
ROLE_ALIASES["yard_manager"] = Role.MANAGER
ROLE_ALIASES["formwork_engineer"] = Role.EDITOR
ROLE_ALIASES["project_manager"] = Role.MANAGER
```

Effective matrix (rows = permission, columns = role; `Y` = allowed,
`Y(p)` = project-scoped, `-` = denied):

Project-scoped filtering enforced in `repository.py` using the existing
`verify_project_access` dependency (same mechanism as `daily_diary` and
`fieldreports`). Site workers attempting cross-project reads receive 404 (not
403) per the IDOR-hardening pattern established in v4.6.1 R7.

## 8. MVP (2 weeks) vs Full (6 weeks)

### MVP — 2-week single wave

Goal: a contractor with one project and 100–500 panels can replace
their spreadsheet. Doka's mobile-portal users would see this as an
"inventory + check-in" tool, not yet as a rental-billing engine.

| In scope                                             | Out of scope                                                   |

| `FormworkAssignment` with simple status (open / closed), no FSM | Full FSM (planned -> delivered -> set -> ... -> returned) |
| `FormworkInspection` with photo (single)             | Periodic-inspection scheduling                                 |
| `FormworkMovement` (delivery / return / transfer)    | `FormworkAccessoryAllocation` audit                            |
| Field PWA: scan, quick mark-set / mark-stripped, flag-damage, offline sync | Calendar planning view, drag-to-replan                |

### Full module — 6-week deliverable

Adds (on top of MVP):
- Commercial layer (`FormworkOrder` + lines, promote-to-PO, rental clock).
- Full FSM with FSM-engine integration and event publication.
- Re-use cycle traceability (`moved_to_assignment_id` chain + report).
- Planning calendar (drag-to-replan with rate impact).
- Yard dashboard, project dashboard, dashboard widget.
- BIM zone linking via canonical-format references; clash module hook.
- HSE inspection cross-link for shoring / falsework.
- Carbon amortisation per re-use cycle.
- Daily diary auto-stub on status transition.
- 8 additional seeded catalogues (Meva, Hünnebeck, RMD, Faresin, Efco, generic-steel, generic-timber, in-house).
- Reports: re-use cycle, idle days, damage chargebacks (CSV + XLSX).
- ~120 backend tests, ~40 frontend tests, ~6 Playwright field scenarios.
- Mobile UX polish: one-hand mode, vibration on scan, bulk-scan-then-act.

Estimated effort: 3 backend + 2 frontend + 0.5 product, 6 calendar weeks (30 working days).

## 9. Open Questions for the Product Owner

1. **Scanning hardware.** Do we target device-camera-only (zxing, free, slower in
   poor light), or also support Bluetooth/USB barcode guns and Zebra hand-held
   PDAs that Doka's yards already deploy? Hardware support pushes timeline +1
   week and brings native-app pressure.
2. **Tenant model for the catalogue.** Is the `FormworkSystem` table shared
   across all tenants (one Doka seed for everyone) or per-tenant (each
   customer can edit their own copy)? Affects seed-loader strategy and how
   community-contributed system seeds are distributed.
3. **Rental-billing depth.** Do we need full accrual accounting (post a daily
   journal entry per unit per day to `oe_finance`), or is end-of-month
   summary roll-up to `oe_costs` enough? Full accrual = +2 weeks and a
   finance-module review.
4. **Owned vs rented separation.** Is "owned-by-customer" a real use case
   (large GCs increasingly own a stake), or are we 100 % rental-yard
   centric? Owned-flow needs depreciation, periodic inspection scheduling,
   and a yard-internal cost-rate alongside the supplier daily rate.
5. **Integration with manufacturer CAD output.** Doka's Tipos exports an
   XML parts list; Peri's PeriCloud exposes a project-data API. Do we ship
   parsers in this module, or land them as separate community modules later
   (preferred per the modules-as-plugins philosophy)? If in-module: scope
   creep risk + per-vendor format drift maintenance burden.

## 10. Reference Comparison

Doka **MyDoka** customer portal:
- Per-project rental list, downloadable delivery / return notes.
- Outstanding-items list pulled from yard ERP.
- E-signed delivery receipts (HTML + PDF).
- No re-use cycle metrics; no on-site condition reports; no offline mobile.
- Built around the supplier's own SAP back-end; closed to non-Doka inventory.

Peri **PeriCloud**:
- 3D pour planner browser viewer.
- Parts list export to CSV / Excel.
- Project-level cost forecast that compares planned vs actual rental days.
- Limited mobile (web-responsive, not offline-first).
- Vendor-locked: only Peri systems load into the planner.

Ulma **Construct** software, RMD Kwikform **TrakFast**, Meva **MevaPlan**:
- Vary in maturity. Common pattern: a planning tool + a yard ERP + a customer
  portal. All vendor-locked; none of them expose the inventory through an open
  API that a general contractor's PMIS could consume.

OpenConstructionERP **Formwork module** target differentiation:
- Vendor-neutral catalogue (every major manufacturer + in-house systems coexist).
- Offline-first mobile worker UX (PWA + sync queue, not a portal).
- Re-use cycle is a first-class metric (none of the above expose it cleanly).
- Open REST API + event bus, integrates with the same project a customer uses
  for BOQ / schedule / HSE / EAC — no silo.
- AGPL community edition with optional commercial; open data export
  (CSV / XLSX / JSON) at every screen.

The module's strategic claim: a customer of Doka, Peri, *or* Ulma can run this
module on top of their existing rental contracts and unify what today lives in
three vendor portals plus an Excel sheet on the foreman's desktop.

## Appendix B — Risks

- **Scope creep into rental-yard ERP.** Doka and Peri's full yard ERPs took
  decades to mature. We commit to the *general contractor* and *small rental
  yard* persona only; we do not chase full warehouse-management features
  (bin slotting, asset-photo training pipelines, automated reorder points).
- **Tipos / PeriCloud integration drift.** Per Q5, we lean on
  community-module pattern to absorb format churn outside the core.
- **Mobile reliability.** Offline-first is hard; the daily-diary module's
  sync queue is the proven internal reference and must be re-used, not
  re-implemented.
- **Multi-currency rental.** A Swiss tenant ordering panels from a German
  yard runs CHF site / EUR contract; the existing currency-discipline
  (string serialisation, server-default `""`, service layer fills from
  tenant preference) carries forward unchanged.
